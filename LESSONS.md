# Lessons

- A newborn research repository can still have strong intent. When the code
  tree is empty, the correct first artifact is a source-backed orientation
  scaffold, not premature implementation.
- In this project, "autarkic" has two coupled meanings that must remain joined:
  formal self-confidence and embodied control of the computational substrate.
- When one repo log points to adjacent implementation work, verify the public
  branch before treating it as current. In this case, SJAS describes newer
  Proflog work than public `jpt4/proflog` exposes on `main`.
- For this repo's standard-library Python tests, keep `tests/__init__.py` so
  plain `python -m unittest discover` finds the suite from the repository root.
- For AS formal-confidence work, a source list is not enough. Exact definition,
  theorem, construction, and boundary anchors should be made structured and
  testable before any self-consistency claim is implemented.
- Keep `_upstream` source checkouts out of the default fast-test critical path.
  Fast tests should validate pinned source-status facts and paths; live clone or
  smoke-test checks belong in ADR evidence or an explicit extended gate.
- For PRC hardware/schematic work, draw nothing until the source constraints
  are structured. The first useful artifact is a witness map that separates
  symbolic RLEM behavior, GELC geometry, UC state, reconfiguration support, and
  candidate physical implementation claims.
- A schematic trace is more useful when it is executable. Recording a diagram
  key and replaying its claimed transition through the Universal Cell probe
  catches drift that a static drawing would hide.
- A rendered schematic should be generated from the structured trace whenever
  practical. Otherwise the human-facing diagram becomes a second, weaker source
  of truth.
- Reusing the schematic trace schema for processor behavior is better than
  adding a one-off artifact. It keeps wire and processor evidence comparable
  while still testing role-specific behavior.
- When a second SVG render is added, generalize the renderer while preserving
  compatibility wrappers and exact-output tests for the first SVG. That keeps
  visual reuse from weakening drift protection.
- Stem reconfiguration evidence must name what it does not cover. A tested
  automail trace is useful, but it is not full stem buffering or dynamic
  circuit reconfiguration.
- A stem reconfiguration render must show the state change, not merely the
  node geometry. Role after-transition and automail consumption are part of the
  visual evidence contract.
- For stem behavior, implementing accumulation separately from command
  execution keeps the PRC source model honest. A full buffer should be an
  explicit boundary until command decoding and target routing are tested.
- After adding a new transition status or behavior, promote only the stable
  subset into the claim surface. The claim should repeat the boundary rather
  than smuggling in future command-decoding obligations.
- When a new stem trace is added, route validation by the actual stem subset.
  Automail and standard-signal buffering share role `stem` but have different
  evidence obligations.
- A buffer SVG has to show buffer state explicitly. The renderer should add
  trace-specific summary fields when generic role/memory/status text would
  hide the actual claim.
- Decode maps should become structured artifacts before execution code depends
  on them. This keeps command semantics reviewable and avoids magic numbers in
  transition logic.
- A source-backed decoder is not the same as source-backed execution. When
  legacy sketches disagree about target and command interpretation, record the
  disagreement before mutating the substrate model.
- Representation unblockers should propagate through every schema boundary.
  A new `Cell` field is not real project state until claim manifests, object
  language, and schematic traces all preserve it.
- Broadening what state can represent is not the same as broadening what
  transitions execute. Tests should prove command tokens are preserved or
  rejected at the current boundary before later routing semantics are added.
- When command semantics diverge by source, split the stable init-family cases
  from unresolved write-buffer or standard-signal cases instead of forcing one
  execution rule too early.
- Once a bounded execution subset is stable, give it a named claim before using
  it as a dependency. That keeps later command work tied to manifest examples
  and proof-certificate coverage rather than raw transition behavior alone.
- Stem schematic traces need dispatch by the active stem mechanism. Empty
  automail plus non-empty `self_mailbox` is mailbox execution, not buffer
  accumulation, even though both use `step_stem_cell`.
- Render summaries should follow the semantic cause of a state change. A
  self-mailbox init can change role like automail does, but its visible proof
  surface is mailbox consumption and cleared command state.
- Boundary behavior deserves claims too. When AS deliberately refuses to
  execute an unresolved command, a preservation claim is better than leaving
  that refusal as an informal test side effect.
- Trace dispatch should use the transition status when the same visible field
  can mean different mechanisms. Non-empty `self_mailbox` plus
  `self-mailbox-unsupported` is a preservation boundary, not an init command.
- No-op evidence still needs visible state. For unsupported commands, the
  important render fact is preservation of mailbox/control/buffer, not absence
  of visual change.
- Command-buffer execution should advance through previously claimed behavior.
  Dispatching self-target init buffers is acceptable because direct
  self-mailbox init semantics are already tested, claimed, and rendered.
- Once a command-buffer behavior is executable, claim it before drawing it.
  The schematic layer should rest on named transition claims where practical,
  not just ad hoc replay behavior.
- Completed-buffer traces need their own validation path when they share the
  same visible fields as accumulation traces. Status-dispatch keeps a
  processed command buffer from being mistaken for another append.
- Command-buffer renders should show the decoded command state directly. A
  role-changing dispatch can look like generic reconfiguration unless the SVG
  exposes buffer before/after and cleared command state.
- When a command-buffer case is deliberately not executed, name the append
  boundary before building the next behavior. That preserves the current
  frontier as a claim instead of an accidental hole between tests.
- Unsupported command-buffer traces should track the live frontier, not the
  frontier that existed when the trace was first written. Neighbor examples
  were useful before delivery landed; after ADR-0044, the unsupported trace
  belongs on self-target non-init commands.
- Unsupported command-buffer renders must show preservation as an active fact.
  When a once-unsupported neighbor command becomes delivered behavior, revise
  the trace and render instead of preserving stale evidence.
- New command-buffer behavior should enter the named claim surface before
  schematic evidence depends on it. That keeps later traces tied to explicit
  proof obligations instead of direct behavior tests alone.
- Delivery renders must expose the exact output channel, not only that output
  changed. Otherwise a wrong-channel command delivery can look visually valid.
- After delivery evidence is complete, decide recipient consumption from source
  status before changing runtime behavior. A delivered token is only half of
  the semantics.
- Recipient command-message consumption should land as init-family behavior
  first. Keeping `standard-signal`, write-buffer, and multi-command inputs at
  the rejection boundary avoids laundering unresolved command semantics through
  an otherwise source-backed slice.
- When recipient command behavior becomes executable, claim it before drawing
  it. Fixed upstream input and stem direct input are similar enough to share a
  predicate, but the predicate must still check the source-specific upstream
  clearing rule.
- A recipient command trace should show where the delivered token entered the
  cell. For fixed cells, the trace is clearer when it records upstream pull and
  upstream clearing instead of pretending the token started as direct input.
- Recipient command renders need their own summary branch. Generic role-change
  text hides the important proof surface: the upstream command token was
  consumed and the recipient's transient command state was cleared.
- When legacy command sources agree on command names but disagree on clearing
  and buffer behavior, record the divergence before implementing. The honest
  next step can be a claim over the current rejection boundary, not execution.
- Rejection claims should include the input source. Fixed direct input and
  fixed upstream input both reject non-init command messages, but upstream
  rejection must also prove the pulled command source was cleared.
- Rejection traces should show the rejected token as active state, not mere
  absence of execution. For pulled-upstream recipient commands, the trace must
  record source clearing and role/memory preservation together.
- Rejection renders need their own summary branch when the state mostly stays
  the same. Generic no-change rendering hides the evidence that the command
  source was actively rejected and cleared.
- A command name appearing in every source is not enough to implement it. For
  write-buffer commands, append semantics, clearing behavior, and buffer-full
  boundaries must agree before runtime execution is honest.
- A command-table entry can name behavior that already exists in another input
  class without defining command-token execution. For `standard-signal`, keep
  ordinary binary-input routing/buffering separate from command-message,
  self-mailbox, and self-target command-buffer execution until a source decides
  that bridge.
- Multiple simultaneous command-message tokens should not silently inherit a
  priority rule. When no source orders them, the honest policy is to reject and
  clear the active command input, then make that boundary visible in claims and
  traces.
