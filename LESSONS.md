- A newborn research repository can still have strong intent. When the code
  tree is empty, the correct first artifact is a source-backed orientation
  scaffold, not premature implementation.
- In this project, "autarkic" has two coupled meanings that must remain joined:
  formal self-confidence and embodied control of the computational substrate.
- When one repo log points to adjacent implementation work, verify the public
  branch before treating it as current. In this case, SJAS describes newer
  Proflog work than public `jpt4/proflog` exposes on `main`.
- For this repo's standard-library Python tests, keep `tests/__init__.py` so
  plain `python -m unittest discover` finds the suite from the repository root.
- For AS formal-confidence work, a source list is not enough. Exact definition,
  theorem, construction, and boundary anchors should be made structured and
  testable before any self-consistency claim is implemented.
- Keep `_upstream` source checkouts out of the default fast-test critical path.
  Fast tests should validate pinned source-status facts and paths; live clone or
  smoke-test checks belong in ADR evidence or an explicit extended gate.
- For PRC hardware/schematic work, draw nothing until the source constraints
  are structured. The first useful artifact is a witness map that separates
  symbolic RLEM behavior, GELC geometry, UC state, reconfiguration support, and
  candidate physical implementation claims.
- A schematic trace is more useful when it is executable. Recording a diagram
  key and replaying its claimed transition through the Universal Cell probe
  catches drift that a static drawing would hide.
- A rendered schematic should be generated from the structured trace whenever
  practical. Otherwise the human-facing diagram becomes a second, weaker source
  of truth.
- Reusing the schematic trace schema for processor behavior is better than
  adding a one-off artifact. It keeps wire and processor evidence comparable
  while still testing role-specific behavior.
- When a second SVG render is added, generalize the renderer while preserving
  compatibility wrappers and exact-output tests for the first SVG. That keeps
  visual reuse from weakening drift protection.
- Stem reconfiguration evidence must name what it does not cover. A tested
  automail trace is useful, but it is not full stem buffering or dynamic
  circuit reconfiguration.
- A stem reconfiguration render must show the state change, not merely the
  node geometry. Role after-transition and automail consumption are part of the
  visual evidence contract.
- For stem behavior, implementing accumulation separately from command
  execution keeps the PRC source model honest. A full buffer should be an
  explicit boundary until command decoding and target routing are tested.
- After adding a new transition status or behavior, promote only the stable
  subset into the claim surface. The claim should repeat the boundary rather
  than smuggling in future command-decoding obligations.
- When a new stem trace is added, route validation by the actual stem subset.
  Automail and standard-signal buffering share role `stem` but have different
  evidence obligations.
- A buffer SVG has to show buffer state explicitly. The renderer should add
  trace-specific summary fields when generic role/memory/status text would
  hide the actual claim.
- Decode maps should become structured artifacts before execution code depends
  on them. This keeps command semantics reviewable and avoids magic numbers in
  transition logic.
- A source-backed decoder is not the same as source-backed execution. When
  legacy sketches disagree about target and command interpretation, record the
  disagreement before mutating the substrate model.
- Representation unblockers should propagate through every schema boundary.
  A new `Cell` field is not real project state until claim manifests, object
  language, and schematic traces all preserve it.
- Broadening what state can represent is not the same as broadening what
  transitions execute. Tests should prove command tokens are preserved or
  rejected at the current boundary before later routing semantics are added.
- When command semantics diverge by source, split the stable init-family cases
  from unresolved write-buffer or standard-signal cases instead of forcing one
  execution rule too early.
