# Development Log

## 2026-05-16 - Initial Orientation Scaffold

- Cloned `https://github.com/jpt4/as` at commit
  `1a2fc06b75f5d33aee6655956c2a56df07a7bfb0`. The repository initially
  contained only `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md~`.
- Reviewed the project prelude in `AGENTS.md`: Autarkic Systems is an
  open-ended cross-disciplinary investigation that subsumes AFS, PRC, and
  SJAS, with a lower-bound objective of theory plus machinic implementation of
  an artificial entity demonstrating cognitive sovereignty.
- Fetched the three referenced subordinate repositories for review:
  - `jpt4/afs` at `a61592eab02a93d480149ce3465af5e3271ca213`.
  - `jpt4/prc` at `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
  - `jpt4/sjas` at `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Checked GitHub metadata and issues. `jpt4/as`, `jpt4/afs`, and `jpt4/sjas`
  had no listed issues; `jpt4/prc` had one closed typo issue.
- Attempted to retrieve the referenced X/Twitter status
  `https://x.com/jpt401/status/1556420237163118598`. The web fetch exposed no
  usable text, and web search did not surface a reliable mirror. Treat that
  reference as uncaptured until a better source is available.
- Added the first ADR-backed documentation scaffold so future work has a
  current public entrypoint, chronological log, durable context, subordinate
  review, and initial roadmap.

## 2026-05-16 - AFS Requirement Definition

- Re-read the live project `AGENTS.md` before continuing work. The active rules
  require ADRs before feature implementation, careful documentation layering,
  active forward motion, and structured tools where useful.
- Listed public repositories under `jpt4` and identified `jpt4/proflog` as a
  relevant adjacent executable frontier because SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md` records
  recent Proflog-side SJAS work.
- Cloned `jpt4/proflog` at `77af848`. The public main branch contains
  `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf`, but not the ADR-0063 through ADR-0068
  material described in the SJAS log.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm`; it failed at the embedded `P1` program definition
  with `Unbound variable: even`. Treat public Proflog main as relevant
  background, not as a passing executable dependency.
- Added `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/afs-requirements.md`, and
  `docs/adr/0002-afs-requirements.md` to turn AFS from a placeholder name into
  a concrete requirement matrix with a gap register and a recommended first
  executable probe.

## 2026-05-16 - Source Manifest

- Added `sources/manifest.json` to pin the reviewed source baseline for AS,
  AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent Proflog.
- Added `docs/source-manifest.md` and `docs/adr/0003-source-manifest.md` to
  explain the manifest, verification commands, and status of each source.
- Verified that `jq` is available for structural manifest checks.
