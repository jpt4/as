# Development Log

## 2026-05-16 - Initial Orientation Scaffold

- Cloned `https://github.com/jpt4/as` at commit
  `1a2fc06b75f5d33aee6655956c2a56df07a7bfb0`. The repository initially
  contained only `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md~`.
- Reviewed the project prelude in `AGENTS.md`: Autarkic Systems is an
  open-ended cross-disciplinary investigation that subsumes AFS, PRC, and
  SJAS, with a lower-bound objective of theory plus machinic implementation of
  an artificial entity demonstrating cognitive sovereignty.
- Fetched the three referenced subordinate repositories for review:
  - `jpt4/afs` at `a61592eab02a93d480149ce3465af5e3271ca213`.
  - `jpt4/prc` at `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
  - `jpt4/sjas` at `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Checked GitHub metadata and issues. `jpt4/as`, `jpt4/afs`, and `jpt4/sjas`
  had no listed issues; `jpt4/prc` had one closed typo issue.
- Attempted to retrieve the referenced X/Twitter status
  `https://x.com/jpt401/status/1556420237163118598`. The web fetch exposed no
  usable text, and web search did not surface a reliable mirror. Treat that
  reference as uncaptured until a better source is available.
- Added the first ADR-backed documentation scaffold so future work has a
  current public entrypoint, chronological log, durable context, subordinate
  review, and initial roadmap.

## 2026-05-16 - AFS Requirement Definition

- Re-read the live project `AGENTS.md` before continuing work. The active rules
  require ADRs before feature implementation, careful documentation layering,
  active forward motion, and structured tools where useful.
- Listed public repositories under `jpt4` and identified `jpt4/proflog` as a
  relevant adjacent executable frontier because SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md` records
  recent Proflog-side SJAS work.
- Cloned `jpt4/proflog` at `77af848`. The public main branch contains
  `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf`, but not the ADR-0063 through ADR-0068
  material described in the SJAS log.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm`; it failed at the embedded `P1` program definition
  with `Unbound variable: even`. Treat public Proflog main as relevant
  background, not as a passing executable dependency.
- Added `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/afs-requirements.md`, and
  `docs/adr/0002-afs-requirements.md` to turn AFS from a placeholder name into
  a concrete requirement matrix with a gap register and a recommended first
  executable probe.

## 2026-05-16 - Source Manifest

- Added `sources/manifest.json` to pin the reviewed source baseline for AS,
  AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent Proflog.
- Added `docs/source-manifest.md` and `docs/adr/0003-source-manifest.md` to
  explain the manifest, verification commands, and status of each source.
- Verified that `jq` is available for structural manifest checks.

## 2026-05-16 - Universal Cell Transition Probe

- Added ADR-0004 for the first code-bearing AS artifact: a tiny fixed-role
  Universal Cell transition probe.
- Wrote `tests/test_universal_cell.py` before implementation. The first run of
  `python -m unittest tests.test_universal_cell` failed with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autarkic_systems'`, confirming the red
  step.
- Implemented `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` with immutable `Cell` and
  `StepResult` records plus `step_fixed_cell`.
- Covered wire right-rotation, processor left-rotation and memory toggle,
  blocked output, upstream pull, stem-init reconfiguration, malformed input
  clearing, invalid role rejection, and invalid memory rejection.
- Added `tests/__init__.py` so the default fast command
  `python -m unittest discover` actually discovers the suite.
- Verified `python -m unittest discover`, `python -m py_compile
  autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py autarkic_systems/__init__.py
  tests/__init__.py tests/test_universal_cell.py`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-16 - Transition Predicate Bridge

- Added ADR-0005 for named predicates over Universal Cell transition results.
- Wrote `tests/test_transition_predicates.py` before implementation. The first
  targeted run failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'autarkic_systems.transition_predicates'`, confirming the red step.
- Implemented `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py` with
  `PredicateResult`, `output_not_overwritten`, `consumed_input_cleared`,
  `fixed_role_memory_rule`, and `stem_init_resets_to_stem`.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 16 tests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Literature Map And Open Problems

- Added `docs/adr/0006-literature-map.md` for the first literature/open-problem
  mapping slice.
- Added `docs/literature-map.md`, organizing AS, AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent
  Proflog/Fitting sources by their role in the AS project.
- Added `docs/open-problems.md`, ranking the next project questions from
  transition-claim formalization through hardware/schematic evidence.
- Corrected the roadmap's duplicate ADR-0005 heading by making the literature
  map ADR-0006.

## 2026-05-17 - Transition Claim Manifest

- Added ADR-0007 for a machine-readable bridge from transition predicate code
  to explicit AS claims.
- Wrote `tests/test_claim_manifest.py` before implementation. The first run
  failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'autarkic_systems.claim_manifest'`, confirming the red step.
- Added `claims/transition_claims.json` with four transition claims, each with
  positive and negative executable examples.
- Added `autarkic_systems/claim_manifest.py` to load and evaluate the manifest
  against implemented predicate functions.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_claim_manifest` passed 4 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 20 tests, `jq -e
  claims/transition_claims.json` passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Probe

- Added ADR-0008 for the first tested stem/reconfiguration slice.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail.py` before implementation. The first run
  failed because `step_stem_cell` did not exist, confirming the red step.
- Extended `Cell` with stem-state fields for `automail`, `control`, and
  `buffer`.
- Added `step_stem_cell` for the automail subset: `wr`, `wl`, `pr`, and `pl`
  reconfigure a stem cell into the corresponding fixed role and memory.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_automail` passed 8 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 28 tests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Claim

- Added ADR-0009 to promote stem automail behavior into the named AS claim
  surface.
- Wrote predicate tests before implementation. The first run failed because
  `automail_reconfigures_stem` did not exist, confirming the red step.
- Implemented `automail_reconfigures_stem` and added the
  `UC-STEM-AUTOMAIL-RECONFIGURES` claim to `claims/transition_claims.json`.
- The claim manifest evaluator initially caught a mismatch because
  `claim_manifest.py` was not preserving stem fields such as `automail` when
  parsing cells. Fixed the loader to parse automail, control, and buffer.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates` passed 10
  tests, `python -m unittest tests.test_claim_manifest` passed 4 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 30 tests, JSON checks passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Proof Apparatus Options

- Re-read `/home/sean/Projects/AGENTS.md`, the AS `AGENTS.md`, and the active
  thread goal before continuing. The project remains an open end-of-month AS
  work goal, and the live branch is `adr-0010-proof-apparatus-options`.
- Cloned and reviewed `namin/leanTAP` at
  `c17864a911c0c3cbd727b43743fdcb19b43714b8` because SJAS ISLA notes point to
  alphaLeanTAP as a possible tableaux direction.
- Reviewed the visible public Proflog source and the SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md`
  Proflog boundary notes again. Public Proflog remains relevant background, but
  it still does not expose the active ADR-006x frontier described by SJAS.
- Added ADR-0010 and `docs/proof-apparatus-options.md`. The decision is to
  start with a minimal AS-local proof-certificate checker for the current
  transition claims, use LeanTAP as a transparent design reference, and defer
  Proflog as a dependency until its active frontier is recovered or replaced.

## 2026-05-17 - Proof Certificate Checker

- Added ADR-0011 for the first proof-object layer over current transition
  claims.
- Wrote `tests/test_proof_certificates.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.proof_certificates` did not exist.
- Added `claims/proof_certificates.json` with one certificate per current
  transition claim. The first rule is `manifest-example`, tying proof steps to
  named claim examples and their expected predicate outcomes.
- Added `autarkic_systems/proof_certificates.py` to load certificates and
  reject missing claim certificates, unknown claims, unknown rules, missing
  examples, duplicate examples, and mismatched expectations.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_proof_certificates` passed 6 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 36 tests, py_compile passed for the new
  module and tests, JSON checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Transition Claim Object Language

- Added ADR-0012 for the first explicit AS object language.
- Wrote `tests/test_object_language.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.object_language` did not exist.
- Added `language/transition_claim_language.json` with explicit syntax classes
  for terms, formulae, sentences, proof objects, and substrate claims.
- Added `autarkic_systems/object_language.py` to validate the language manifest
  and the current transition-claim/proof-certificate surface.
- Added `docs/transition-claim-language.md` as the human-facing note for the
  language boundary.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_object_language` passed 6 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 42 tests, py_compile passed for the new
  module and tests, JSON checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Willard Definition Map

- Rechecked publication status before continuing. `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 42 tests, but `git push origin main ...` failed with `Permission to
  jpt4/as.git denied to Sean-Kenneth-Doherty`; the authenticated account has
  only read permission on `jpt4/as`.
- Restored the missing local SJAS witness checkout by cloning
  `https://github.com/jpt4/sjas.git` to `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/sjas`.
  The checkout resolved to the pinned commit
  `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Added ADR-0013 for P5: a definition-granularity Willard anchor map over
  Willard 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2020.
- Wrote `tests/test_willard_definition_map.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.willard_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/willard_definition_map.json` with anchors for the core
  definitions, constructions, theorem statements, and boundary results needed
  before AS can claim Willard-style formal confidence.
- Added `autarkic_systems/willard_map.py` to load and validate required source
  coverage, local SJAS PDF witnesses, unique anchor IDs/loci, and explicit AS
  relevance.
- Added `docs/willard-definition-map.md` as the human-facing guide to the
  anchor map.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_willard_definition_map` passed 4
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 46 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e . sources/willard_definition_map.json`
  passed, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Committed ADR-0013 as `854e345 Add Willard definition map`, fast-forwarded it
  into local `main`, and verified `python -m unittest discover` passed 46 tests
  on integrated `main`.
- Direct pushes of `adr-0013-willard-definition-map` and `main` to
  `https://github.com/jpt4/as.git` failed with 403 permission errors.
- Created the fork `https://github.com/Sean-Kenneth-Doherty/as` and pushed
  integrated `main` plus all ADR branches there.
- Opened upstream issue `https://github.com/jpt4/as/issues/1` to report the
  ready fork, latest commit, validation status, and blocked upstream push
  permission.

## 2026-05-17 - Proflog Source Status

- Added ADR-0014 for P6: decide whether public `jpt4/proflog` main can be an
  AS dependency.
- Checked the public Proflog remote. `git ls-remote
  https://github.com/jpt4/proflog.git HEAD refs/heads/*` exposed only `main` at
  `77af8481d9f41a439eb42e1d8268a5b39f7c5c33`.
- Rebuilt the disposable `_upstream` cache for SJAS and Proflog and confirmed
  public Proflog contains only `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf` as project
  payload.
- Compared public Proflog against `sjas/nachlass/LOG.md`; ADR-0063 through
  ADR-0068 terms such as `tableau-proof/3`, `subst-prf/4`, `subst-code/2`,
  `SelfCons1`, and `IS#_D(beta)` are present in the SJAS log but absent from
  public Proflog main.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm` in the public Proflog checkout. It failed at
  `proflog.scm:893:5` with `Unbound variable: even`.
- Wrote `tests/test_proflog_frontier_status.py` before adding the structured
  status artifact. The red run failed because
  `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json` and
  `docs/proflog-frontier-status.md`, recording the decision:
  `do-not-depend-on-public-main`.
- Adjusted the Willard-map fast validator to check pinned witness paths rather
  than requiring disposable `_upstream` clones to exist on every default test
  run.
- Opened `https://github.com/jpt4/proflog/issues/1` asking where the
  ADR-0063 through ADR-0068 source lives and whether public Proflog main should
  be treated as background only.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_willard_definition_map
  tests.test_proflog_frontier_status` passed 8 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 50 tests, py_compile passed for touched Python files, JSON
  checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - PRC Hardware Witness Map

- Added ADR-0015 for P7: define the PRC hardware/schematic witness path before
  drawing or simulating hardware.
- Refreshed the disposable PRC checkout at `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc`
  and reviewed PRC README criteria, GELC/RLEM geometry, switchable-circulator
  physical hypotheses, RALA/reconfiguration notes, the UC formal model, the
  ASM simulator, and schematic figure witnesses.
- Wrote `tests/test_prc_hardware_witness_map.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.prc_hardware_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json` with required witnesses for UC
  criteria, GELC geometry, RLEM literature, circulator physical hypotheses,
  RALA/reconfiguration pressure, the UC formal model, the ASM simulator, and
  PRC schematic figures.
- Added `autarkic_systems/prc_hardware_map.py` to load and validate required
  witness coverage, PRC-local path pinning, unique witness IDs/loci, AS
  relevance, simulation constraints, and next AS actions.
- Added `docs/prc-hardware-witness-map.md` as the human-facing guide. The
  recommended next artifact is
  `single-node-triangular-rlem-schematic-and-uc-transition-trace`.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons so P7 now points to the source-backed hardware witness layer.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_prc_hardware_witness_map` passed 4
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 54 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e .
  sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Single-Node Schematic Trace

- Added ADR-0016 for the first concrete artifact after the PRC hardware witness
  map: `single-node-triangular-rlem-schematic-and-uc-transition-trace`.
- Wrote `tests/test_single_node_schematic_trace.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace` did not exist.
- Added `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` with one triangular
  RLEM/Universal Cell key, north/east/west ports, four interpretive layers, all
  current AS `Cell` fields, and one fixed-role wire transition trace.
- Added `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` to load and validate the
  schematic trace against ADR-0015's witness map and replay the recorded
  transition through the existing Universal Cell probe.
- Added `docs/single-node-schematic-trace.md` as the human-facing explanation
  of the schematic key, layer boundaries, and executable trace.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, the PRC hardware
  witness note, ADR-0015 follow-up, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has a
  structured schematic trace rather than only a source witness map.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 62 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e .
  schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Single-Node Schematic SVG

- Added ADR-0017 for the first visible render of the structured single-node
  schematic trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_single_node_schematic_svg.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` to render a deterministic SVG from
  `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` and validate that a given
  SVG exactly matches renderer output.
- Added `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`, showing the
  triangular RLEM/Universal Cell node, north/east/west ports, right-memory
  routing, trace metadata, and interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/single-node-schematic-svg.md` as the human-facing render-boundary
  note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, ADR-0016 follow-up,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has a generated visual schematic view.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 7
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 69 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, XML parsing passed for
  `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Processor Memory Toggle Trace

- Added ADR-0018 for the second schematic-linked Universal Cell trace: a
  processor cell with left memory that routes a standard signal and toggles
  memory to right.
- Wrote `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `PROCESSOR_MEMORY_TOGGLE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was
  not yet exported from `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json` with the processor
  role, left-memory signal flow, expected output, complete AS `Cell` field
  mapping, PRC witness references, and expected memory toggle.
- Generalized `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` with
  `load_schematic_trace` and `validate_schematic_trace` while preserving the
  ADR-0016 single-node loader/validator wrappers.
- Added `docs/processor-memory-toggle-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, single-node trace
  note, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has both wire and processor
  schematic-linked traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_trace`
  passed 22 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 76 tests, py_compile
  passed for the touched module and new test, `jq -e .
  schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Reconfiguration Trace

- Added ADR-0019 for the first schematic-linked stem reconfiguration trace: a
  stem cell with `pl` automail reconfiguring into processor-left.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `STEM_AUTOMAIL_RECONFIGURATION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json` with the stem
  role, `pl` automail command, expected processor-left target, automail
  consumption, complete AS `Cell` field mapping, PRC witness references, and
  explicit automail reconfiguration flow.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` so generic trace validation
  distinguishes fixed-role signal routing from stem automail reconfiguration.
- Added `docs/stem-automail-reconfiguration-trace.md` as the human-facing
  trace boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, single-node trace
  note, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has wire, processor, and one stem
  automail schematic-linked trace.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_trace
  tests.test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace` passed 30 tests, `python -m
  unittest discover` passed 84 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module
  and new test, `jq -e .
  schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Processor Memory Toggle SVG

- Added ADR-0020 for rendering the ADR-0018 processor memory-toggle trace as a
  generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_svg.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `PROCESSOR_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Generalized `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with
  `render_schematic_svg` and `validate_schematic_svg` while preserving the
  ADR-0017 single-node wrappers.
- Added `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.svg`, showing the processor
  role, left-memory routing, before/after memory, trace metadata, and
  interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/processor-memory-toggle-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, processor trace note,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has generated SVG renders for both
  wire and processor fixed-role traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 14 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 91 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new
  test, XML parsing passed for both checked-in SVGs, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail SVG

- Added ADR-0021 for rendering the ADR-0019 stem automail reconfiguration trace
  as a generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail_svg.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `STEM_AUTOMAIL_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with the stem SVG artifact path
  and conditional reconfiguration summary fields for traces whose role or
  automail changes.
- Added `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.svg`, showing the stem
  role before transition, processor role after transition, memory before/after,
  automail consumption, trace metadata, and interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/stem-automail-reconfiguration-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem trace note,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has generated SVG renders for wire,
  processor, and stem automail traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_automail_svg
  tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg`
  passed 21 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 98 tests, py_compile
  passed for the touched module and new test, XML parsing passed for all three
  checked-in SVGs, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation

- Added ADR-0022 for the first standard-signal stem buffer subset from the PRC
  formal model.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because current `step_stem_cell` returned `idle` for one-hot
  standard-signal stem inputs.
- Extended `step_stem_cell` so a one-hot standard input selects the control
  rail, matching control input appends `1`, non-matching one-hot input appends
  `0`, full buffers report `stem-buffer-full` without consuming input, and
  malformed stem input is rejected and cleared.
- Preserved automail priority over standard-signal buffering.
- Updated `language/transition_claim_language.json` after the full suite caught
  that the object-language status vocabulary did not yet include the new stem
  buffer statuses.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation.md` as the human-facing subset and
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons so P2 no longer describes stem behavior as automail-only.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_buffer_accumulation
  tests.test_stem_automail` passed 14 tests, `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 104 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new test,
  `jq -e . language/transition_claim_language.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Claim

- Added ADR-0023 to promote ADR-0022 stem buffer accumulation into the named
  AS claim and proof-certificate surface.
- Wrote direct predicate tests before implementation. The red run failed
  because `stem_buffer_accumulates` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `stem_buffer_accumulates`, covering control-rail selection, matching
  and non-matching bit append, full-buffer boundary preservation, and
  malformed-input rejection for the ADR-0022 statuses.
- Added `UC-STEM-BUFFER-ACCUMULATES` to `claims/transition_claims.json` with
  positive control-selection, positive append, positive full-buffer-boundary,
  and negative wrong-bit examples.
- Added a `manifest-example` proof certificate for the new claim and updated
  `language/transition_claim_language.json` with the new predicate symbol.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-claim.md` and updated README, roadmap, literature
  map, open problems, transition-claim language note, project memory, and
  lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates
  tests.test_claim_manifest tests.test_proof_certificates
  tests.test_object_language` passed 31 tests, JSON checks passed for the
  claim/proof/language manifests, py_compile passed for the touched predicate
  module and test, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation Trace

- Added ADR-0024 for a schematic-linked trace of one matching-input stem buffer
  append.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `STEM_BUFFER_ACCUMULATION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was
  not yet exported from `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.json`, recording a stem cell
  with active control `[0, 1, 0]`, matching input `[0, 1, 0]`, and expected
  buffer append from `[0]` to `[0, 1]`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` so stem automail and stem
  buffer traces use separate alignment validation branches.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer note,
  project memory, and lessons.

  artifact path and conditional control/buffer summary fields for traces whose
  buffer changes.
- Added `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.svg`, showing the active
  control rail, buffer before/after, cleared input, trace metadata, and
  interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer trace
  note, project memory, and lessons.

  command offsets, PRC source witness metadata, and the AS bit-order convention
  `accumulated-msb-first`.
- Added `autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py` to load, validate, enumerate,
  and decode five-bit buffers without executing commands.
- Added `docs/stem-command-buffer-map.md` as the human-facing decoder boundary
  note.
- Added a refinement red step for noncanonical target-range and command-name
  maps; validation now rejects maps that merely cover values but change the
  PRC grouping or command identity.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer note,
  project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_command_buffer_map` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 132 tests, py_compile passed for

  structured source-status artifact. The red run failed because
  `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json`, recording the
  formal command table dependency, formal process-buffer execution anchor,
  legacy `raa.scm` target/command divergence, legacy semsim/fsmsim

  note, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_command_execution_source_status`
  passed 4 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 136 tests, py_compile
  passed for the new test,
  `jq -e . sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json` passed, and

- Added ADR-0028 for explicit `Cell.self_mailbox` representation as the next
  allowed slice after ADR-0027.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_mailbox_representation.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `Cell` had no `self_mailbox` field and the language
  and schematic trace vocabularies did not name it.
- Added `self_mailbox` with the ADR-0026 command-message vocabulary to
  `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`.

  run failed because command-message channel values were rejected and the
  object-language `signals` vocabulary did not list them.
- Expanded `Signal` and channel validation in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`
  to accept the eight command-message tokens.
- Updated `language/transition_claim_language.json` so `terms.signals` matches
  the expanded channel-token vocabulary.

  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `self_mailbox_executes_init_command`,
  `UC-STEM-SELF-MAILBOX-INIT-COMMAND`, proof-certificate coverage, and the

  validation path so neighbor delivery traces are not mistaken for ordinary
  stem buffer accumulation.
- Added `docs/neighbor-command-buffer-delivery-trace.md` as the human-facing
  trace boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem command
  execution source-status note/artifact, and project memory.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_trace`
  passed 9 tests and the adjacent trace/claim/source-status/object-language
  suite passed 35 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 267 tests,
  py_compile passed for the touched Python module and tests, JSON parsing
  passed for the source-status and neighbor-delivery trace manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Command Buffer Delivery SVG

- Added ADR-0047 for a generated SVG render of the neighbor command-buffer
  delivery trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_svg.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `NEIGHBOR_COMMAND_BUFFER_DELIVERY_SVG_ARTIFACT` did not exist in
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `NEIGHBOR_COMMAND_BUFFER_DELIVERY_SVG_ARTIFACT` and a renderer summary
  branch that exposes the delivered output channel and cleared command state
  before generic buffer summaries.
- Generated `schematics/neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Added `docs/neighbor-command-buffer-delivery-svg.md` as the human-facing
  render boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem command
  execution source-status note/artifact, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_svg`
  passed 7 tests and the adjacent SVG/trace/source-status/object-language
  suite passed 36 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 274 tests,
  py_compile passed for the touched Python module and tests, JSON parsing
  passed for the source-status and neighbor-delivery trace manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Command Consumption Source Status

- Added ADR-0048 to decide the recipient-side command-message consumption
  frontier from PRC sources before changing runtime behavior.
- Restored the disposable PRC source cache by cloning
  `https://github.com/jpt4/prc.git` to `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc`.
  The checkout is at manifest-pinned commit
  `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
- Inspected the formal model input-channel `process-special-message` anchor
  and legacy RAA/FSM/Sem simulator special-message sets.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_command_consumption_source_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/recipient_command_consumption_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/recipient_command_consumption_source_status.json` and
  `docs/recipient-command-consumption-source-status.md`.
- Updated the stem command execution source-status artifact so the next
  executable slice is recipient-side init-family command-message consumption,
  while `standard-signal`, write-buffer, and multi-command input policy remain
  blocked.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons.
- Verified
  `python -m unittest tests.test_recipient_command_consumption_source_status`
  passed 5 tests and the adjacent stem source-status suite passed 9 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 279 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient and stem source-status
  manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message Consumption

- Added ADR-0049 for the first executable recipient-side command-message
  slice: single init-family input-channel command messages only.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_messages.py` before implementation
  and updated adjacent command-token, neighbor-delivery, and source-status
  tests. The red run over the focused suite failed with ten failures and one
  error because init-family command-message inputs still returned
  `rejected-input`, the transition language lacked
  `recipient-init-command-message-processed`, and the source-status artifacts
  still described the slice as future work.
- Updated `step_fixed_cell` and `step_stem_cell` to consume one
  `stem-init`, `wire-r-init`, `wire-l-init`, `proc-r-init`, or `proc-l-init`
  command-message input. The implementation reuses the self-mailbox
  role/memory target map, clears command state, handles pulled upstream command
  messages on fixed cells, and preserves rejection for `standard-signal`,
  write-buffer, and multi-command inputs.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-consumption.md` and updated the
  recipient and stem source-status artifacts, transition language, README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused recipient/adjacent suite passed 28 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 286 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched Python module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the transition
  language and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message Claim

- Added ADR-0050 to promote the ADR-0049 recipient init command-message
  behavior into the named transition-claim and proof-certificate surface.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_message_claim.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `recipient_init_command_message_processed` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `recipient_init_command_message_processed` to
  `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`. The predicate covers fixed
  direct input, fixed pulled-upstream input, and stem direct input for the
  init-family command-message subset. It checks target role/memory, cleared
  input/output, cleared command state, and source-specific upstream handling.
- Added `UC-RECIPIENT-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-PROCESSED` to
  `claims/transition_claims.json`, added the matching proof-certificate entry,
  and updated the transition-claim object language.
- Updated the recipient and stem source-status artifacts so the next slice is
  a schematic-linked recipient init command-message trace rather than claim
  promotion.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-claim.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused claim/source-status/predicate suite passed 38 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 293 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched predicate module and tests, JSON parsing passed for claim,
  certificate, language, and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message Trace

- Added ADR-0051 for a schematic-linked trace over the ADR-0050 recipient init
  command-message claim.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_message_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` and a dedicated
  recipient init command-message alignment validator to
  `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py`.
- Added `schematics/recipient_init_command_message_trace.json`, replaying one
  fixed processor-left recipient that pulls upstream `wire-r-init`, processes
  it as a recipient init command message, and becomes wire-right with upstream
  and command state cleared.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-trace.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, recipient/stem source-status
  artifacts, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused trace/source-status/schematic suite passed 44 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 302 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched schematic module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient
  trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message SVG

- Added ADR-0052 for the rendered SVG view of the ADR-0051 recipient init
  command-message trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_message_svg.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_SVG_ARTIFACT` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_SVG_ARTIFACT` and a recipient init
  command-message summary branch to `render_schematic_svg()`, exposing
  upstream before/after, recipient role/memory after, cleared input/output,
  empty self-mailbox, and cleared control/buffer state.
- Generated `schematics/recipient_init_command_message_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-svg.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, recipient/stem source-status
  artifacts, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused recipient SVG/trace/source-status suite passed 39
  tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 309 tests, py_compile passed for
  the touched SVG renderer and tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient
  trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Source Status

- Added ADR-0053 to decide the recipient-side non-init command-message
  frontier before changing runtime behavior.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_source_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`, blocking
  recipient-side `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, `write-buf-one`, and
  multi-command input execution.
- Recorded the formal/legacy `standard-signal` divergence and the RAA,
  SEMSIM, and FSMSIM write-buffer clearing/buffer-behavior divergences.
- Updated recipient and stem source-status frontiers so the next safe slice is
  a named non-init command-message rejection-boundary claim, not execution.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-source-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused recipient non-init/source-status suite passed 14 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 314 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched source-status tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient non-init,
  recipient consumption, and stem source-status manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Rejection Claim

- Added ADR-0054 to promote the ADR-0053 recipient non-init command-message
  rejection boundary into the named transition-claim and proof-certificate
  surface.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_rejection_claim.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected` to
  `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`. The predicate covers fixed
  direct non-init rejection, fixed pulled-upstream non-init rejection, and stem
  multi-command conflict rejection.
- Added `UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED` to
  `claims/transition_claims.json`, added the matching proof-certificate entry,
  and updated the transition-claim object language.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice is a schematic-linked rejection trace, not
  claim promotion or execution.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-rejection-claim.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused rejection-claim/source-status/predicate suite passed
  37 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 322 tests, py_compile passed
  for the touched predicate module and tests, JSON parsing passed for claim,
  certificate, language, and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Rejection Trace

- Added ADR-0055 to make one recipient non-init command-message rejection
  visible as a schematic-linked executable trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_NON_INIT_COMMAND_REJECTION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added the artifact identity, validation alignment, and
  `schematics/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.json` for a fixed
  processor-left recipient rejecting upstream `standard-signal` on channel 1.
- The trace preserves role and memory, clears upstream/input/output command
  state, satisfies `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected`, and does not
  execute the blocked command.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice is a rendered SVG for the rejection trace.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-rejection-trace.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused rejection-trace/source-status suite passed 41 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 332 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched schematic module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the rejection
  trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Rejection SVG

- Added ADR-0056 for the rendered SVG view of the ADR-0055 recipient non-init
  command-message rejection trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_rejection_svg.py` before
  implementation. The first red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_NON_INIT_COMMAND_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `RECIPIENT_NON_INIT_COMMAND_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` and a recipient
  non-init rejection summary branch to `render_schematic_svg()`, exposing
  upstream before/after, role/memory preservation, cleared input/output,
  empty self-mailbox, and preserved control/buffer state.
- Generated `schematics/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice moves from rejection evidence to source
  resolution for write-buffer, standard-signal, and multi-command semantics.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-rejection-svg.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused rejection-SVG/source-status suite passed 31 tests and
  the full SVG suite passed 77 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed
  339 tests, py_compile passed for the touched SVG renderer and tests, JSON
  parsing passed for the source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Write-Buffer Command Semantics Status

- Added ADR-0057 to decide whether `write-buf-zero` and `write-buf-one`
  command execution is source-backed enough to implement.
- Wrote `tests/test_write_buffer_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`, keeping
  write-buffer command execution blocked across recipient command-message,
  self-mailbox, and self-target command-buffer surfaces.
- Recorded the formal-model gap: write-buffer commands are named in the
  command table and special-message paths, but no executable write-buffer
  primitive or clearing/buffer-full boundary is defined.
- Recorded the legacy divergence: RAA appends with a buffer-full guard, SEMSIM
  appends then clears the buffer through its stem wrapper, and FSMSIM appends
  while clearing self-mailbox/input state without the same buffer-full guard.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice moves to `standard-signal` source
  resolution and multi-command conflict policy.
- Added `docs/write-buffer-command-semantics-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused write-buffer/source-status suite passed 19 tests.

- Added ADR-0058 to decide whether `standard-signal` command-token execution
  is source-backed enough to implement.
- Wrote `tests/test_standard_signal_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json`, keeping
  `standard-signal` command-token execution blocked across recipient
  command-message, self-mailbox, and self-target command-buffer surfaces.
- Recorded the formal-model split: ordinary standard-signal behavior is
  binary-input high-rail/routing behavior, while the command table also names
  `standard-signal` at command offset 0 without defining command-token
  execution semantics.
- Recorded the legacy divergence: RAA excludes `standard-signal` from
  `special-messages` but maps the final command-buffer case to it, while
  SEMSIM and FSMSIM exclude it from special messages and classify standard
  input separately.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice moves to multi-command recipient input
  conflict policy.
- Added `docs/standard-signal-command-semantics-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused standard-signal/write-buffer/source-status suite passed
  24 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 349 tests, py_compile passed
  for the touched source-status tests, JSON parsing passed for the
  standard-signal, write-buffer, recipient, and stem source-status manifests,
  and `git diff --check` passed.

- Added ADR-0059 to select a policy for multiple simultaneous recipient
  command-message inputs.
- Wrote `tests/test_multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.json`, selecting
  reject-and-clear for two or more recipient command-message tokens and
  confirming no priority or sequencing rule is inferred.
- Verified existing runtime behavior for fixed direct conflicts, fixed
  upstream conflicts, and stem direct conflicts without changing
  `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`.
- Added a fixed all-init command conflict example to
  `UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED` and added matching
  proof-certificate coverage.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, write-buffer,
  standard-signal, and stem source-status artifacts so the next safe slice is
  a schematic-linked multi-command rejection trace.
- Added `docs/multi-command-recipient-input-policy-status.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused multi-command/source-status/claim suite passed 46 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 353 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched source-status and claim tests, JSON parsing passed for the
  multi-command, standard-signal, write-buffer, recipient, stem, claim, and
  certificate manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Multi-Command Recipient Rejection Trace

- Added ADR-0060 to make the ADR-0059 reject-and-clear policy visible as a
  schematic-linked trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_multi_command_recipient_rejection_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` and routed the
  new artifact through the existing recipient non-init rejection alignment
  validator.
- Added `schematics/multi_command_recipient_rejection_trace.json`, replaying a
  fixed `wire/right` recipient rejecting simultaneous `wire-r-init` and
  `proc-l-init` command-message inputs.
- Verified the trace replays through `step_fixed_cell`, satisfies
  `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected`, validates against the PRC
  hardware witness map, and rejects drifted flow or uncleared input.
- Updated source-status frontiers so the next safe slice is a rendered SVG for
  the multi-command rejection trace.
- Added `docs/multi-command-recipient-rejection-trace.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused multi-command trace/source-status suite passed 37 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 362 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched schematic trace module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the
  multi-command trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

- Added ADR-0061 for a generated SVG render of the ADR-0060 multi-command
  recipient rejection trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_multi_command_recipient_rejection_svg.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` and routed the
  multi-command trace through the existing recipient non-init rejection SVG
  summary branch.
- Generated `schematics/multi_command_recipient_rejection_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Updated source-status frontiers so the current multi-command rejection
  evidence ladder is complete and the next command-execution work returns to
  source resolution for `standard-signal` or write-buffer semantics.
- Added `docs/multi-command-recipient-rejection-svg.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused multi-command SVG test passed 7 tests, the adjacent
  multi-command/source-status suite passed 44 tests, and `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 369 tests. `py_compile` passed for the touched renderer and
  tests, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests and trace,
  and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Guile ASMSIM Command Semantics Status

- Added ADR-0062 after scanning the local PRC source tree for evidence that
  might resolve `standard-signal` or write-buffer command-token semantics.
- Wrote `tests/test_guile_asmsim_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/guile_asmsim_command_semantics_status.json` was absent.
- Added `sources/guile_asmsim_command_semantics_status.json`, recording
  `practice/legacy/guile-asmsim.scm` as blocker-strengthening evidence rather
  than runtime authority: init-family-only `special-messages`, binary
  `write-buf`, self-mailbox numeric append, and a divergent command-list
  expression.
- Cross-linked the evidence from the standard-signal, write-buffer, and stem
  command source-status artifacts.
- Added `docs/guile-asmsim-command-semantics-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.

  adjacent command source-status suite passed 29 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 374 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new test, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests, and

## 2026-05-17 - ASMSIM Process-Buffer Status

- Added ADR-0063 after reviewing `practice/asmsim.scm` as the next local PRC
  source that might resolve blocked `standard-signal` or write-buffer
  command-token semantics.
- Wrote `tests/test_asmsim_process_buffer_status.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `sources/asmsim_process_buffer_status.json` was
  absent.
- Added `sources/asmsim_process_buffer_status.json`, recording
  `practice/asmsim.scm` as blocker-strengthening process-buffer evidence:
  the source says the process-buffer branch needs documentation, warns to
  confirm message-list codes, uses code-shape predicates, and contains a
  literal `msg-list` placeholder.
- Cross-linked the evidence from the standard-signal, write-buffer, and stem
  command source-status artifacts.
- Added `docs/asmsim-process-buffer-status.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused ASMSIM process-buffer source-status test passed 5
  tests, the adjacent command source-status suite passed 34 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 379 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new test, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests, and

- Added ADR-0064 after reviewing PRC's official TLA files as a possible formal
  source for blocked Universal Cell command semantics.
- Wrote `tests/test_official_tla_universal_cell_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/official_tla_universal_cell_status.json` was absent.
- Added `sources/official_tla_universal_cell_status.json`, recording
  `universal-cell.tla` as a partial 45-line activation skeleton,
  `universalcell.tla` as a one-line stub, and `uc.tla` as empty.
- Cross-linked the evidence from the standard-signal, write-buffer, and stem
  command source-status artifacts.
- Added `docs/official-tla-universal-cell-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, PRC hardware witness notes, project
  memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused TLA/adjacent source-status suite passed 33 tests and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 384 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new test, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Transition Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0065 to make one already implemented recipient init command-message
  transition inspectable as a single evidence path.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_transition_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle` was absent.
- Added `evidence/recipient_init_command_message_bundle.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/evidence_bundle.py`.
- The bundle ties `UC-RECIPIENT-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-PROCESSED` and its
  positive fixed-upstream `wire-r-init` example to the proof certificate,
  recipient init schematic trace, committed SVG render, PRC hardware witness
  map, and recipient/non-init/standard-signal/write-buffer source-status
  boundaries.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-transition-evidence-bundle.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, recipient command source
  status, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused bundle and recipient source-status tests passed 10
  tests, the adjacent evidence stack passed 47 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 389 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new validator and touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the bundle and
  recipient source-status manifest, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Evidence Bundle Registry

- Added ADR-0066 to make transition evidence bundles discoverable and
  batch-verifiable.
- Wrote `tests/test_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `load_evidence_bundle_registry` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle`.
- Added `evidence/manifest.json` with the ADR-0065 recipient init evidence
  bundle as the first registered bundle.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/evidence_bundle.py` with registry dataclasses,
  loading, duplicate detection, missing-path detection, entry-to-bundle
  agreement checks, and whole-bundle validation.
- Added `docs/evidence-bundle-registry.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused registry/bundle tests passed 10 tests, the adjacent
  evidence stack passed 52 tests, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 394
  tests. `py_compile` passed for the touched evidence bundle module and tests,
  JSON parsing passed for the registry and bundle manifests, and

- Added ADR-0067 to expose evidence registry validation as a direct project
  command.
- Wrote `tests/test_evidence_bundle_cli.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `format_registry_validation_report` and the CLI runner were
  absent from `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle`.
- Added `format_registry_validation_report`, `run_evidence_bundle_cli`, and a
  module entrypoint for
  `python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json`.
- The command prints `OK` or `FAIL` validation lines and returns exit code `0`
  only when every registry validation result is accepted.

  docs, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused CLI/registry tests passed 9 tests, the actual module
  command printed an all-`OK` report, the adjacent evidence stack passed 56
  tests, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 398 tests. `py_compile`
  passed for the touched module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry
  and registered bundle manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

  and CLI now validate two bundles: the recipient init transition and the
  recipient non-init rejection boundary.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-evidence-bundle.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, evidence registry docs, recipient
  non-init source status, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused bundle/registry/CLI/source-status tests passed 20
  tests, the actual registry CLI printed an all-`OK` report for two bundles,
  the adjacent rejection/evidence stack passed 73 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 404 tests. `py_compile` passed for the

  tests, the actual registry CLI printed an all-`OK` report for three bundles,
  the adjacent multi-command/rejection/evidence stack passed 68 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 410 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry, new bundle, and touched
  source-status manifest, and `git diff --check` passed.

- Added ADR-0070 to make the evidence registry fail closed over sibling
  `*_bundle.json` files.
- Extended `tests/test_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because registry validation did not emit
  `registry-completeness` and did not reject an unregistered sibling bundle.
- Added `source_path` tracking to loaded evidence registries and a
  `registry-completeness` validation result that discovers sibling bundle
  files beside the manifest.
- Updated the CLI report path so
  `python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json`
  shows the completeness check.

  run failed because `registry_validation_report_payload` was absent.
- Added `registry_validation_report_payload` and `--format text|json` to the
  evidence registry CLI while preserving text as the default.
- The JSON payload records registry ID, overall accepted status, bundle count,
  result count, and per-subject validation results. Failure payloads keep the
  same non-zero exit behavior as text output.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, evidence registry
  docs, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused CLI tests passed 8 tests, both actual CLI text and JSON
  modes passed, the adjacent evidence stack passed 31 tests, and

  and CLI now validate four bundles: recipient init execution, recipient
  non-init rejection, multi-command rejection, and direct self-mailbox init.
- Aligned `schematics/self_mailbox_init_trace.json` and its generated SVG with
  the named claim example so the integrated validator checks one exact
  transition path.

  roadmap, literature map, open problems, evidence registry docs, stem command
  source status, project memory, and lessons.

  focused stack passed 48 tests, the adjacent self-mailbox/evidence stack
  passed 76 tests, both actual CLI text and JSON modes passed for four
  bundles, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 422 tests. `py_compile`
  passed for the touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry, new
  bundle, touched source status, and aligned trace.

## 2026-05-17 - Self-Mailbox Unsupported Evidence Bundle

  passed for the touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry, new
  bundle, touched source status, and aligned trace.

## 2026-05-17 - Self Command-Buffer Init Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0074 to register the completed self-target command-buffer init
  dispatch as the sixth transition evidence bundle.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_command_buffer_init_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `evidence/self_command_buffer_init_bundle.json` was absent.
- Added `evidence/self_command_buffer_init_bundle.json` for the positive
  `self command buffer processor left init` example under

  neighbor-delivery sender transition into recipient init-family command
  consumption.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.transition_chains` was absent.
- Added `autarkic_systems/transition_chains.py` with
  `execute_neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain`, which runs one stem sender step,
  installs the delivered output tuple as recipient upstream state only when

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Chain Claim

- Added ADR-0078 to promote the ADR-0077 two-step handoff into a named chain
  claim and proof-certificate surface without forcing it into the
  single-transition claim language.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_claim.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `autarkic_systems.chain_claims` was absent.
- Added `claims/transition_chain_claims.json` for
  `UC-CHAIN-NEIGHBOR-DELIVERY-RECIPIENT-CONSUMED`, with one positive
  `neighbor-b/proc-l-init` consumption example and three boundary examples.
- Added `claims/transition_chain_proof_certificates.json`,
  `autarkic_systems/transition_chain_predicates.py`, and
  `autarkic_systems/chain_claims.py` for manifest-example evaluation and
  certificate verification over transition-chain examples.

  predicates, `UC-CHAIN-` sentence prefixes, proof-object rules, and active
  chain claim/certificate manifest paths.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_object_language.py` to validate the chain
  language manifest and the current chain claim/certificate surface.
- Added `docs/transition-chain-claim-language.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, the chain-claim note, and the
  single-transition claim-language note.
- Verified the focused chain object-language test passed 5 tests, the adjacent
  chain-language/chain-claim/object-language stack passed 20 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 464 tests. JSON parsing passed for the
  chain language manifest, `py_compile` passed for the new module and test,
  `git diff --check` passed, and the evidence registry JSON CLI still reported
  8 accepted bundles.

- Added ADR-0080 to expose transition-chain claim validation as an
  operator-facing command.
- Wrote `tests/test_transition_chain_claim_cli.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because chain-claim CLI/report functions were absent from
  `autarkic_systems.chain_claims`.
- Added report dataclasses, `validate_transition_chain_claim_project`,
  text/JSON report formatting, and `run_chain_claim_cli` to
  `autarkic_systems/chain_claims.py`.
- The new command validates the chain language manifest, chain examples, chain
  proof certificates, and chain claim surface:
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_claims`.

  delivery recipient-consumption chain inspectable as one composed-chain
  evidence artifact.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle` was absent.
- Added `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_chain_bundle.json` so the chain
  bundle stays separate from the top-level single-transition evidence registry.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` to validate schema,
  executable chain example status, chain predicate acceptance, proof
  certificate coverage, chain language validity, the two underlying transition
  evidence bundles, source-status JSON, boundary terms, and text/JSON CLI
  output.
- Added `docs/neighbor-delivery-chain-evidence-bundle.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, chain-claim/language notes,
  evidence-registry note, memory, and lessons.

  `python -m unittest discover` passed 479 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Chain Trace

- Added ADR-0082 to record the ADR-0077 neighbor delivery
  recipient-consumption handoff as a dedicated transition-chain trace before
  adding any renderer.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_trace.py` before implementation
  and updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` to
  require the chain evidence bundle to validate the trace. The red run failed
  because `autarkic_systems.chain_trace` was absent, `chain_trace_path` was
  missing from the bundle model, and `chain-trace` was not yet a bundle
  validation subject.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain_trace.json`,
  recording the stem sender step, delivered `proc-l-init` tuple, recipient
  initial state, recipient handoff state, recipient init-consumption step, and
  chain boundaries.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_trace.py` to replay the sender step, verify
  the output-to-upstream handoff, replay the recipient step, and replay the
  full chain helper.
- Updated `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_chain_bundle.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` so the composed-chain evidence
  bundle validates the new trace.
- Added `docs/neighbor-delivery-chain-trace.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, recipient-chain, chain-claim, and
  chain-evidence notes, memory, and lessons.

- Added ADR-0083 to render the ADR-0082 transition-chain trace as a checked SVG
  artifact.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_svg.py` before implementation and
  updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` to require
  the chain evidence bundle to validate the SVG. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.chain_svg` was absent, `chain_svg_path` was missing from
  the bundle model, and `chain-svg` was not yet a bundle validation subject.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_svg.py` to render the two-cell sender/handoff/
  recipient view from the chain trace and validate XML metadata, exact renderer
  output, visible labels, and routed flows.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain_trace.svg` as the
  checked renderer output. The first green attempt caught and fixed a trailing
  blank-line drift in the committed SVG.
- Updated `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_chain_bundle.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` so the composed-chain evidence
  bundle validates the SVG.
- Added `docs/neighbor-delivery-chain-svg.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, chain trace, chain evidence, memory, and
  lessons.

  checked SVG, `jq` parsed the updated bundle, `py_compile` passed for the
  new/touched modules and tests, the chain evidence JSON CLI reported
  `accepted: true` with `result_count: 9` and an accepted `chain-svg` subject,
  the chain claims JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true`, the existing
  transition evidence registry JSON CLI still reported 8 accepted bundles,
  `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 492
  tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Evidence Registry

- Added ADR-0084 to make transition-chain evidence bundles discoverable and
  batch-validatable without merging them into the single-transition evidence
  registry.
- Wrote `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because the chain registry loader/report functions were
  absent from `autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle`.
- Added `evidence/chains/manifest.json`, registering the neighbor delivery
  recipient-chain evidence bundle.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` with registry dataclasses,
  loader, validator, text report, JSON payload, and `--registry` CLI support
  while preserving the existing single-bundle default.
- Added `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, chain evidence note, memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused chain registry test passed 10 tests, adjacent
  registry/bundle tests passed 18 tests, the chain registry CLI passed in text
  and JSON modes with `accepted: true` and `bundle_count: 1`, the existing
  single-bundle chain evidence JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` and
  `result_count: 9`, the existing transition evidence registry JSON CLI still
  reported 8 accepted bundles, `jq` parsed the new registry, `py_compile`
  passed for the touched module and focused test, `git diff --check` passed,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed 502 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Evidence CLI Target Selection

- Added ADR-0085 to make `--bundle` and `--registry` mutually exclusive for
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle`.
- Wrote `tests/test_chain_evidence_cli_target_selection.py` before
  implementation. The red run showed the parser accepted both flags and
  silently validated the registry.
- Updated `run_chain_evidence_bundle_cli` to put `--bundle` and `--registry`
  in an argparse mutually exclusive group while preserving the checked-in
  single-bundle default when neither flag is supplied.
- Updated `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md`, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the explicit target-selection rule.
- Verified the focused target-selection test passed 2 tests, adjacent chain
  CLI/registry/bundle tests passed 20 tests, the single-bundle chain evidence
  JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` with `result_count: 9`, the chain
  registry JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` with `bundle_count: 1`,
  `py_compile` passed for the touched module and focused test,
  `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 504
  tests.

- Added ADR-0086 to make chain evidence registry JSON output list the concrete
  bundles validated in a run.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `chain_registry_validation_report_payload` did
  not include a `bundles` key.
- Extended `chain_registry_validation_report_payload` so registry JSON includes
  each registered bundle ID, path, chain claim ID, and expected status.
- Updated `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md`, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the JSON payload contract.
- Verified the focused chain registry test passed 10 tests, adjacent chain
  CLI/registry/bundle tests passed 20 tests, chain registry JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 1`, and the expected `bundles` entry, the
  single-bundle chain evidence JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` and
  `result_count: 9`, `py_compile` passed for the touched module and focused
  test, `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed
  504 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Registry JSON Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0087 to make failed chain evidence registry JSON output summarize
  rejected validation subjects directly.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `chain_registry_validation_report_payload` did
  not include `failed_subjects`.
- Added `failed_subjects` to chain registry JSON output. Successful registry
  runs report an empty list; drifted registries report the rejected validation
  subjects in result order.
- The first green attempt showed that a drifted in-place registry correctly
  fails both missing-path validation and closed-index completeness, so the test
  expectation now preserves that signal.
- Updated `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md`, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the failure-summary contract.
- Verified the focused chain registry test passed 12 tests, adjacent chain
  CLI/registry/bundle tests passed 22 tests, chain registry JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 1`, and `failed_subjects: []`, the
  single-bundle chain evidence JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` and
  `result_count: 9`, `py_compile` passed for the touched module and focused
  test, `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed
  506 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Bundle JSON Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0088 to make single-bundle chain evidence JSON output summarize
  rejected validation subjects directly.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because `chain_evidence_bundle_report_payload`
  did not include `failed_subjects`.
- Added `failed_subjects` to chain bundle JSON output. Successful bundle runs
  report an empty list; a drifted expected chain status reports
  `chain-claim-example` and `chain-trace`.
- Updated the chain evidence bundle note, chain registry note, roadmap, memory,
  and lessons with the parallel bundle/registry failure-summary contract.
- Focused verification passed 10 bundle tests; adjacent chain bundle, registry,
  and CLI target-selection verification passed 24 tests. Bundle JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `result_count: 9`, and `failed_subjects: []`; registry JSON
  reported `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 1`, and `failed_subjects: []`.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and the full default suite passed, with
  `python -m unittest discover` running 508 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Vertical Chain Demo Report

- Added ADR-0089 to make the current transition-chain work visible as one
  operator-facing claim-to-evidence report.
- Wrote `tests/test_chain_demo_report.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.chain_demo` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_demo.py`, reusing the existing chain evidence
  validator and formatting the bundle, claim, predicate, positive example,
  chain function, expected status, validation summary, trace, SVG, lower-level
  transition bundles, source-status files, and boundary terms as text or JSON.
- Updated README, the chain evidence bundle note, open problems, roadmap,
  memory, lessons, and the dedicated vertical demo report note.
- Verified the focused demo test passed 6 tests; adjacent demo, chain bundle,
  chain registry, and CLI target-selection tests passed 30 tests. The text CLI
  printed the full claim-to-evidence path, JSON CLI reported `accepted: true`,
  `validation.result_count: 9`, and `validation.failed_subjects: []`,
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 514 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Demo Artifact Presence

- Added ADR-0090 to make the vertical chain demo explicit about whether each
  listed evidence artifact exists.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_demo_report.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because demo evidence layers lacked `exists`, the payload lacked
  `missing_evidence_paths`, and text output did not summarize missing paths.
- Extended `autarkic_systems.chain_demo` so every evidence layer reports
  `exists`, the payload exposes `missing_evidence_paths`, and text output
  prints `Missing evidence paths: none` for the checked-in bundle.
- Updated README, the vertical demo note, the chain evidence bundle note, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the artifact-presence contract.
- Verified the focused demo test passed 7 tests; adjacent demo, chain bundle,
  chain registry, and CLI target-selection tests passed 31 tests. Text demo
  output reported `Missing evidence paths: none`; JSON demo output reported
  `missing_evidence_paths: []` and `exists: true` for every evidence layer.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 515 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain Claim

- Added ADR-0091 to promote the delivered non-init recipient rejection
  boundary into its own transition-chain claim.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_claim.py` and
  `tests/test_transition_chain_claim_cli.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `neighbor_delivery_rejected_by_recipient` did not exist.
- Added `neighbor_delivery_rejected_by_recipient`, the
  `UC-CHAIN-NEIGHBOR-DELIVERY-RECIPIENT-REJECTED` manifest claim, its
  manifest-example proof certificate, and the language predicate symbol.
- Updated the chain claim docs, transition-chain language docs, README, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the second chain claim.
- Verified the focused chain claim test passed 8 tests; adjacent chain claim,
  object-language, and CLI tests passed 20 tests; adjacent chain evidence,
  registry, and demo tests passed 29 tests. Chain claim JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `claim_count: 2`, `certificate_count: 2`, and
  `chain-examples: evaluated 7 examples`; chain evidence JSON remained
  accepted with `result_count: 9` and `failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 518 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain Trace

- Added ADR-0092 to record the delivered non-init recipient rejection boundary
  as a composed-chain trace before SVG or evidence-bundle promotion.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because
  `NEIGHBOR_DELIVERY_REJECTION_CHAIN_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` did not exist.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_trace.json` for
  the `neighbor-c/write-buf-one` delivery, handoff, recipient rejection, and
  `recipient-not-consumed` chain status.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.chain_trace` so trace validation can accept an
  expected rejection status when replayed status and cells match the artifact.
- Updated README, the chain trace note, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the rejection-trace layer.
- Verified the focused chain trace test passed 11 tests; adjacent trace,
  claim, object-language, and CLI tests passed 31 tests; adjacent evidence,
  registry, and demo tests passed 29 tests. Chain evidence JSON remained
  accepted with `result_count: 9` and `failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 522 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain SVG

- Added ADR-0093 to render the delivered non-init recipient rejection chain
  trace as a checked SVG artifact.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_svg.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because
  `NEIGHBOR_DELIVERY_REJECTION_CHAIN_SVG_ARTIFACT` did not exist.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.chain_svg` so the handoff label derives its channel
  index from the delivered tuple instead of hard-coding channel 1.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_trace.svg`,
  showing `recipient-not-consumed`, `sender output[2] -> recipient upstream[2]`,
  delivered tuple `[_, _, write-buf-one]`, and recipient `rejected-input`.
- Updated README, the chain SVG note, the chain trace note, open problems,
  roadmap, memory, and lessons with the rejection SVG layer.
- Verified the focused SVG test passed 9 tests; adjacent SVG, trace, and
  evidence tests passed 30 tests; adjacent registry and demo tests passed 19
  tests. Chain evidence JSON remained accepted with `result_count: 9` and
  `failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 525 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0094 to give the delivered non-init recipient rejection chain an
  integrated evidence bundle and registry coverage.
- Added `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_evidence_bundle.py` and
  updated `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because the rejection bundle file and
  registry entry were missing.
- Added `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_bundle.json`,
  linking the rejection chain claim, proof certificate, language, trace, SVG,
  neighbor-delivery transition bundle, recipient non-init rejection transition
  bundle, and source-status records.
- Registered the rejection bundle in `evidence/chains/manifest.json`, bringing
  the chain evidence registry to two bundles.
- Updated README, chain evidence bundle docs, chain registry docs, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the rejection bundle.
- Verified focused rejection bundle and registry tests passed 17 tests; the
  adjacent chain evidence bundle, rejection bundle, registry, and CLI
  target-selection tests passed 29 tests. Rejection bundle JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `result_count: 9`, and `failed_subjects: []`; registry JSON
  reported `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 2`, and `failed_subjects: []`.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 530 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Demo Registry Report

- Added ADR-0095 to expose the whole transition-chain evidence registry through
  the vertical chain demo report.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_demo_report.py` before implementation. The first
  red run failed because `build_chain_demo_registry_report` was missing. A
  second red test then caught missing registered bundle paths raising
  `FileNotFoundError` instead of returning a structured rejected report.
- Extended `autarkic_systems.chain_demo` with `--registry` mode, registry
  validation, per-bundle demo report summaries, accepted/failed bundle counts,
  missing-path summaries, and argparse rejection for ambiguous `--bundle` plus
  `--registry` target selection.
- Updated README, chain registry docs, chain evidence bundle docs, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, lessons, and the vertical demo report note with
  the registry demo command and failure-reporting contract.
- Verified the focused demo report test passed 13 tests; adjacent demo,
  registry, consumed-bundle, and rejection-bundle tests passed 40 tests. Demo
  registry JSON reported `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 2`,
  `accepted_count: 2`, `failed_count: 0`, and `missing_evidence_paths: []`.
  Demo registry text named both registered chain bundles. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 536 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Project Status Report

- Added ADR-0096 to make the current evidence state and blocked command-token
  frontier visible from one command.
- Added `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.project_status` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/project_status.py`, which reuses the transition
  evidence registry validator, the chain evidence registry validator, and the
  current recipient non-init, `standard-signal`, and write-buffer source-status
  JSON files.
- The status report now emits text and JSON, reports 8 accepted transition
  evidence bundles and 2 accepted chain evidence bundles on the checked-in
  path, names `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one` as the
  blocked command-token frontier, and returns structured failure output for
  missing source-status files.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the new status command.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 5 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, chain registry, and chain demo tests passed 43
  tests. Text CLI reported accepted status, both bundle counts, the blocked
  command list, and no missing source-status files. JSON CLI reported
  `accepted: true`, transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, and
  the same blocked command list. `py_compile` passed for the touched module and
  focused test. `git diff --check` and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 541 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Project Status Registry Failures

- Added ADR-0097 to make project-status registry path failures structured
  report output instead of tracebacks.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed in four missing-registry cases with `FileNotFoundError` for the
  transition and chain registry loaders.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so transition and chain registry
  loading are summarized independently. Missing registries now report
  `failed_subjects: ["registry-file"]`, `bundle_count: 0`, the requested path,
  and a failed `registry-file` result while preserving the other readable
  status sections.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the structured registry-failure contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 9 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 34 tests. A
  missing transition registry JSON run exited `1` and reported
  `transition_evidence.failed_subjects: ["registry-file"]`; a missing chain
  registry text run exited `1` and named the missing registry path. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and no missing source-status files. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 545 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Invalid Registries

- Added ADR-0098 to distinguish malformed registry files from missing registry
  files in the project status report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because invalid transition and chain registries still reported
  `failed_subjects: ["registry-file"]`, and text output listed them under
  missing registry files.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so missing registry paths keep
  `registry-file`, while existing registry files with JSON/schema/load errors
  report `registry-json`. Text output now names invalid registry files
  separately.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the refined failure contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 12 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 37 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and no missing or invalid source-status files.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 548 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Frontier Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0099 to give the project status frontier section a compact
  `failed_subjects` summary.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed in five accepted, missing, invalid, and mixed source-status cases
  because `frontier.failed_subjects` was absent.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so frontier output reports an empty
  failure-subject list on the checked-in path, `source-status-file` for missing
  source-status files, `source-status-json` for malformed source-status files,
  and both subjects in stable order when both failure modes occur.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the frontier failure-summary contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 14 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 39 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 550 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source Status Shape

- Added ADR-0100 to reject source-status JSON that parses but lacks the minimal
  shape needed by the project status frontier report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run showed `{}` was silently accepted as an empty frontier, while `[]`
  crashed with `AttributeError` because the report tried to call `.get` on a
  list.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so source-status inputs must be
  JSON objects with non-empty text `decision` and `safe_next_slice` fields.
  Shape failures now report `source-status-schema`, while JSON parse failures
  keep reporting `source-status-json`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the source-status shape contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 16 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 41 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 552 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Schema Version

- Added ADR-0101 to make the project status JSON contract explicitly
  versioned.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed with `KeyError: 'schema_version'` in both the in-process report
  and JSON CLI output.
- Added top-level `schema_version: 1` to
  `autarkic_systems.project_status` reports.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the schema-version contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 16 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 41 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 1`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, and
  `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 552 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source Command Shape

- Added ADR-0102 to require source-status records consumed by the project
  status command to expose at least one command token.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because a source-status record with `decision` and
  `safe_next_slice`, but no `command`, `commands`, or
  `blocked_runtime_commands`, was accepted as an empty blocked-command
  frontier.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so commandless source-status
  records report `source-status-schema`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the command-token shape contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 17 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 42 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 1`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, blocked commands
  `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, and
  `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 553 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source Command Attribution

- Added ADR-0103 to attribute blocked commands to individual source-status
  entries in the project status JSON report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because the project status report still emitted
  `schema_version: 1` and did not yet expose per-source `commands` lists.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so accepted
  `frontier.source_statuses` entries include extracted `commands`, and bumped
  `PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION` to `2`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the source command-attribution contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 17 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 42 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 2`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, and
  per-source command attribution for the recipient, standard-signal, and
  write-buffer source-status files. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 553 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Nonempty Source Commands

- Added ADR-0104 to reject blank command-token strings in source-status records
  consumed by the project status command.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because a source-status record with `commands:
  ["standard-signal", "  "]` was accepted as a valid frontier contributor.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so blank strings in `command`,
  `commands`, or `blocked_runtime_commands` report `source-status-schema`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the nonempty source command-token contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 18 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 43 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 2`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source
  command attribution, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 554 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Nonempty Source Text

- Added ADR-0105 to reject whitespace-only source-status `decision` and
  `safe_next_slice` fields in the project status command.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because source-status records with blank decision text or blank
  safe-next text were accepted as valid frontier contributors.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so `decision` and
  `safe_next_slice` must be non-whitespace text, reporting
  `source-status-schema` otherwise.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the nonempty source-status text contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 20 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 45 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 2`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source
  command attribution, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 556 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Command Token Types

- Added ADR-0106 to reject non-text command-token entries in source-status
  command lists consumed by the project status command.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because a source-status record with `commands:
  ["standard-signal", 0]` was accepted after silently dropping the integer.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so non-string entries in
  `commands` or `blocked_runtime_commands` report `source-status-schema`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the command-token type contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 21 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 46 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 2`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source
  command attribution, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 557 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Command Field Shapes

- Added ADR-0107 to reject malformed command-token field container shapes in
  source-status records consumed by the project status command.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because non-text `command`, scalar `commands`, and scalar
  `blocked_runtime_commands` fields were accepted when another command-token
  field supplied a usable command.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so malformed `command`,
  `commands`, and `blocked_runtime_commands` field shapes report
  `source-status-schema`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the command-token field-shape contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 24 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 49 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 2`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source
  command attribution, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 560 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Resolution Questions

- Added ADR-0108 to expose source-status `required_resolution_questions` IDs
  from the project status JSON report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because the project status report still emitted
  `schema_version: 2` and did not yet expose per-source resolution question
  IDs.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so accepted
  `frontier.source_statuses` entries include `required_resolution_questions`,
  and bumped `PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION` to `3`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the resolution-question attribution contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 24 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 49 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 3`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source
  command attribution, standard-signal and write-buffer resolution question
  IDs, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 560
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Resolution Question Shape

- Added ADR-0109 to reject malformed source-status
  `required_resolution_questions` metadata in the project status command.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because scalar `required_resolution_questions`, non-object
  entries, and blank `question_id` values were accepted and silently dropped
  from the report.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so malformed resolution-question
  metadata reports `source-status-schema`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the resolution-question shape contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 27 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 52 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 3`, `accepted: true`,
  transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked
  commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source
  command attribution, standard-signal and write-buffer resolution question
  IDs, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 563
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Text Resolution Questions

- Added ADR-0110 to render source-status resolution question IDs in the default
  project status text report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because the text report omitted the `Resolution questions:`
  section.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so text status output now names the
  standard-signal and write-buffer blocker question IDs while preserving the
  JSON `schema_version: 3` contract.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the text-report question surface.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 29 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 54 tests. The
  checked-in text status now reports accepted transition evidence with 8
  bundles, accepted chain evidence with 2 bundles, the blocked commands, and
  text resolution-question lines for standard-signal and write-buffer
  blockers. The checked-in JSON status reported `schema_version: 3`,
  `accepted: true`, transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`,
  aggregate blocked commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and
  `write-buf-one`, per-source command attribution, standard-signal and
  write-buffer resolution question IDs, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 565 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Resolution Question Summaries

- Added ADR-0111 to expose source-status resolution question summaries from
  the project status report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because the report still emitted `schema_version: 3`, lacked
  per-source `resolution_questions`, and text output listed question IDs
  without summaries.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so accepted
  `frontier.source_statuses` entries include summary-bearing
  `resolution_questions` while retaining `required_resolution_questions`, and
  bumped `PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION` to `4`.
- Updated the text status report so each blocker question renders as
  `question_id: summary` under its command label.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the schema 4 summary-bearing question surface.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 29 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 54 tests. The
  checked-in text status now reports accepted transition evidence with 8
  bundles, accepted chain evidence with 2 bundles, blocked commands, and
  summary-bearing text resolution-question lines for standard-signal and
  write-buffer blockers. The checked-in JSON status reported
  `schema_version: 4`, `accepted: true`, transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain
  `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked commands `standard-signal`,
  `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source command attribution,
  preserved `required_resolution_questions` ID lists, summary-bearing
  `resolution_questions`, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 565 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Blocked Runtime Surfaces

- Added ADR-0112 to expose source-status `blocked_runtime_surfaces` in project
  status.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because the report still emitted `schema_version: 4`, lacked
  per-source `blocked_runtime_surfaces`, text output omitted the blocked
  runtime surface section, and malformed surface lists were accepted.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so accepted
  `frontier.source_statuses` entries include `blocked_runtime_surfaces`, and
  bumped `PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION` to `5`.
- Updated text status output so each contributing command label names its
  blocked runtime surfaces.
- Added source-status schema validation for malformed
  `blocked_runtime_surfaces` fields.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the schema 5 blocked-runtime-surface contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 33 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 58 tests. The
  checked-in text status now reports accepted transition evidence with 8
  bundles, accepted chain evidence with 2 bundles, blocked commands, blocked
  runtime surfaces for standard-signal and write-buffer blockers, and
  summary-bearing resolution-question lines. The checked-in JSON status
  reported `schema_version: 5`, `accepted: true`, transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, aggregate blocked commands `standard-signal`,
  `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`, per-source command attribution,
  per-source `blocked_runtime_surfaces`, preserved
  `required_resolution_questions` ID lists, summary-bearing
  `resolution_questions`, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 569 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Transition Registry JSON Entries

- Added ADR-0113 to make transition evidence registry JSON list the concrete
  registered transition bundles, matching the chain registry JSON pattern.
- Updated `tests/test_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because the transition registry JSON payload did not include a
  `bundles` key.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle.registry_validation_report_payload`
  so JSON output includes each registered bundle ID, path, claim ID, and
  expected status.
- Updated README, evidence-bundle registry docs, open problems, roadmap,
  memory, and lessons with the transition registry JSON entry contract.
- Verified the focused evidence bundle registry test passed 15 tests; adjacent
  evidence registry, chain registry, and project status tests passed 60 tests.
  The transition evidence registry JSON reported `accepted: true`,
  `bundle_count: 8`, and all eight registered transition bundle entries. The
  checked-in project status JSON still reported `schema_version: 5`,
  `accepted: true`, transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`,
  aggregate blocked commands `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and
  `write-buf-one`, per-source command attribution, blocked runtime surfaces,
  resolution questions, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 571 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Transition Registry JSON Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0114 to add a compact `failed_subjects` list to transition
  evidence registry JSON, matching the chain registry JSON contract.
- Updated `tests/test_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because transition registry JSON did not include
  `failed_subjects`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle.registry_validation_report_payload`
  so successful transition registry JSON reports `failed_subjects: []`, and
  rejected registry runs report the rejected validation subjects in order.
- The initial green implementation exposed the expected live-registry boundary:
  a drifted in-process transition registry also reports `registry-completeness`
  when bundle files remain on disk but are removed from the registry, matching
  the chain registry completeness behavior.
- Updated evidence-bundle registry docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the transition registry JSON failure-summary contract.
- Verification passed: focused transition registry tests ran 17 tests; the
  adjacent transition/chain/project-status regression ran 62 tests;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; transition registry JSON,
  chain registry JSON, and project status JSON were accepted with
  `failed_subjects: []`; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 573 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Registry Bundles

- Added ADR-0115 to carry concrete transition and chain registry bundle
  entries into project status JSON.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because project status remained `schema_version: 5`, and
  registry summaries lacked `bundles` on both accepted and registry-load
  failure paths.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so registry summaries include
  `bundles` from the underlying registry payloads, registry load failures
  report `bundles: []`, and project status JSON reports `schema_version: 6`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the project status registry-bundle contract.
- Verification passed: focused project status tests ran 33 tests; adjacent
  project-status/transition-registry/chain-registry tests ran 62 tests;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; project status JSON reported
  `schema_version: 6`, accepted transition evidence with all eight transition
  bundle entries, accepted chain evidence with both chain bundle entries, and
  `frontier.failed_subjects: []`; transition and chain registry JSON remained
  accepted with empty `failed_subjects`; and `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 573 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Text Registry Bundles

- Added ADR-0116 to render concrete transition and chain evidence bundle IDs
  and paths in the default project status text report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because the text report omitted `Transition evidence bundles:`
  and `Chain evidence bundles:` sections, including the `none` fallback for
  failed registry summaries.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status.format_project_status_report` with
  registry bundle text lines while preserving project status JSON
  `schema_version: 6`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the text registry-bundle contract.
- Verification passed: focused project status tests ran 33 tests; adjacent
  project-status/transition-registry/chain-registry tests ran 62 tests;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; default project status text
  reported all eight transition bundle IDs and both chain bundle IDs with
  paths; project status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 6`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 573 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source AS Boundary

- Added ADR-0117 to require non-empty top-level `as_boundary` text on
  source-status records consumed by project status.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because missing and blank `as_boundary` fields were accepted,
  and the checked-in recipient non-init command-message source-status surfaced
  in project status with `as_boundary: ""`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so missing or blank `as_boundary`
  reports `source-status-schema`.
- Added a top-level `as_boundary` to
  `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`, preserving the
  existing nested standard-signal, write-buffer, and multi-command boundary
  details.
- Updated README, project-status docs, recipient non-init source-status docs,
  open problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the source-status boundary
  contract.
- Verification passed: focused project status tests ran 35 tests; adjacent
  project-status/recipient-source-status/transition-registry/chain-registry
  tests ran 69 tests; `py_compile`, `jq`, and `git diff --check` passed;
  project status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 6` and exposed
  non-empty `as_boundary` text for all accepted source-status entries; default
  project status text remained accepted; and `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 575 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Text AS Boundaries

- Added ADR-0118 to render accepted source-status AS boundaries in the default
  project status text report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because the text report omitted an `AS boundaries:` section.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status.format_project_status_report` with
  AS boundary text lines while preserving project status JSON
  `schema_version: 6`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the text AS-boundary contract.
- Verification passed: focused project status tests ran 35 tests; adjacent
  project-status/recipient-source-status/transition-registry/chain-registry
  tests ran 69 tests; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; default
  project status text reported all three source-status AS boundaries; project
  status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 6`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 575 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Self Non-Init Boundary Coverage

- Added ADR-0119 to make the existing unsupported self-command claim/proof
  surfaces explicit for all three blocked non-init command tokens.
- Updated the self-mailbox unsupported and command-buffer unsupported claim
  tests before implementation. The red run failed because both manifest
  surfaces only had a positive `write-buf-one` example and lacked positive
  `standard-signal` and `write-buf-zero` examples.
- Updated `claims/transition_claims.json` with positive examples for
  self-mailbox `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`
  preservation, plus self-target command-buffer `standard-signal`,
  `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one` append-boundary preservation.
- Updated `claims/proof_certificates.json` with matching `manifest-example`
  proof steps for every new example. Runtime behavior stayed unchanged.
- Updated README, open problems, roadmap, memory, lessons, and the affected
  claim docs to state the expanded explicit boundary coverage.
- Verification passed: focused unsupported-claim and proof-certificate tests
  ran 19 tests; adjacent evidence-bundle, evidence-registry, and project-status
  regression tests ran 62 tests; JSON parsing, `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, project status text/JSON, and transition evidence
  registry JSON passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 577 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Evidence Bundle Covered Examples

- Added ADR-0120 to let transition evidence bundles name broader positive
  manifest coverage with optional `covered_positive_examples` while preserving
  one trace-aligned `positive_example`.
- Updated the self-mailbox unsupported and command-buffer unsupported evidence
  bundle tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `TransitionEvidenceBundle` did not expose `covered_positive_examples`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle` so omitted
  `covered_positive_examples` defaults to the primary positive example, and so
  every covered example must exist, be positive, match the bundle expected
  status, and evaluate true.
- Updated `evidence/self_mailbox_unsupported_bundle.json` and
  `evidence/command_buffer_unsupported_bundle.json` to list all three covered
  ADR-0119 positive examples.
- Updated README, evidence bundle docs, registry docs, open problems, roadmap,
  memory, and lessons with the covered-example validation contract.
- Verification passed: focused unsupported evidence-bundle tests ran 12 tests;
  adjacent evidence-bundle/evidence-registry/project-status tests ran 64
  tests; JSON parsing, `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, transition evidence
  registry JSON, and project status text/JSON passed; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 579 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Registry Covered Example JSON

- Added ADR-0121 to expose transition bundle positive-example coverage in the
  registry JSON and project-status JSON first-run surfaces.
- Updated evidence registry and project status tests before implementation.
  The red run failed because transition registry JSON bundle entries lacked
  `positive_example` and `covered_positive_examples`, and project status still
  reported `schema_version: 6`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle.registry_validation_report_payload`
  so each transition bundle JSON entry carries `positive_example` and
  `covered_positive_examples`, with structured empty fallback values when a
  bundle cannot be loaded.
- Bumped `autarkic_systems.project_status` to `schema_version: 7`, carrying
  the enriched transition bundle entries into project status JSON while
  leaving project status text unchanged.
- Updated README, project-status docs, evidence-bundle registry docs, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the covered-example JSON
  contract.
- Verification passed: focused registry/status tests ran 52 tests; adjacent
  registry/status/unsupported-evidence tests ran 64 tests; `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, transition evidence registry JSON, and project status
  text/JSON passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 579 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Text Covered Examples

- Added ADR-0122 to render transition bundle primary and covered positive
  examples in the default project status text report while preserving project
  status JSON `schema_version: 7`.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because the text report omitted the unsupported self-mailbox
  `positive example:` line and did not yet render covered-example lines.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so bundle text rendering includes
  optional `positive_example` and `covered_positive_examples` fields when
  present. Chain bundle text stayed unchanged because chain bundle entries do
  not expose those fields.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the text covered-example contract.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 35 tests; focused
  project-status and evidence-registry tests ran 52 tests; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` passed; default project status text rendered the
  self-mailbox and command-buffer covered examples; project status JSON
  remained accepted at `schema_version: 7`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 579 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source-Status Cross-Links

- Added ADR-0123 to expose source-status `additional_source_statuses`
  cross-links in project status JSON while keeping the default text report
  unchanged.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 38 tests and failed because project status still reported
  `schema_version: 7`, did not expose the cross-links, and accepted malformed
  `additional_source_statuses` metadata.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so each accepted
  `frontier.source_statuses` entry carries `additional_source_statuses`, with
  omitted cross-links reported as `[]` and malformed cross-links rejected as
  `source-status-schema`.
- Bumped project status JSON to `schema_version: 8`, carrying the Guile
  ASMSIM, ASMSIM process-buffer, and official TLA source-status cross-links
  behind the standard-signal and write-buffer blockers.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the source-status cross-link JSON contract.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 38 tests; focused
  project-status plus referenced source-status tests ran 63 tests;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; project status JSON was accepted
  at `schema_version: 8` with the cross-links; default project status text
  remained accepted; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 582 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Text Source-Status Cross-Links

- Added ADR-0124 to render source-status `additional_source_statuses`
  cross-links in the default project status text report while preserving
  project status JSON `schema_version: 8`.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 40 tests and failed because the text report omitted the
  `Additional source statuses:` section and the no-cross-link fallback.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so default text groups
  source-status cross-links by blocked command label and renders each as
  `ADR -> path: summary`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the text source-status cross-link contract.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 40 tests; focused
  project-status plus referenced source-status tests ran 65 tests;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; default project status text
  rendered the standard-signal and write-buffer source-status cross-links;
  project status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 8`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 584 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source-Status Cross-Link Paths

- Added ADR-0125 to require source-status `additional_source_statuses` paths
  consumed by project status to point to existing files.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 41 tests and failed because a source-status record with a
  missing cross-link path was still accepted.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so missing cross-link targets
  reject the owning source-status record as `source-status-schema`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the cross-link path existence contract.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 41 tests; focused
  project-status plus referenced source-status tests ran 66 tests;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; default project status text
  remained accepted with the standard-signal and write-buffer cross-links;
  project status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 8`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 585 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source-Status Cross-Link JSON Targets

- Added ADR-0126 to require source-status `additional_source_statuses` paths
  consumed by project status to point to parseable top-level JSON objects.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 43 tests and failed because existing invalid-JSON and
  non-object JSON cross-link targets were still accepted.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so invalid JSON and non-object JSON
  cross-link targets reject the owning source-status record as
  `source-status-schema`.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Self-Mailbox Exception Evidence

- Added ADR-0127 to promote the PRC formal-model self-mailbox exception into
  the standard-signal command-semantics source-status artifact.
- Updated `tests/test_standard_signal_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run executed 6 tests and failed because
  `formal_model_self_mailbox_exception` was absent.
- Updated `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` and
  `docs/standard-signal-command-semantics-status.md` to record
  `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc/theory/official/formal-model.txt` lines
  207-218 as evidence that stem self-mailbox `standard-signal` must not be
  treated as ordinary binary-input standard-signal behavior by default.
- Verification passed: focused standard-signal, write-buffer, and
  project-status tests ran 54 tests; JSON formatting, `py_compile`, and
  `git diff --check` passed; project status text and JSON remained accepted at
  `schema_version: 8`; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 588 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Command Offset Resolution

- Added ADR-0128 to resolve the standard-signal `command-table-offset`
  question in favor of the formal PRC stem command-buffer map from ADR-0026.
- Updated `tests/test_standard_signal_command_semantics_status.py` and
  `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red run
  executed 50 tests and failed because `resolved_resolution_questions` was
  absent and project status still reported `command-table-offset` as
  unresolved.
- Updated `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` and
  `docs/standard-signal-command-semantics-status.md` so
  `command-table-offset` is recorded as resolved by
  `sources/stem_command_buffer_map.json`, where `standard-signal` is formal
  offset `0`.
- Verification passed: standard-signal, project-status, and stem command-map
  tests ran 58 tests; JSON formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check`
  passed; project status text no longer listed `command-table-offset`; project
  status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 8`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 589 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Command Bit Source Evidence

- Added ADR-0129 to record that `write-buf-zero` and `write-buf-one` carry
  literal `0` and `1` append bits across the formal model and the RAA, SEMSIM,
  and FSMSIM witnesses.
- Updated `tests/test_write_buffer_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run executed 6 tests and failed because
  `command_bit_source` was absent.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` and
  `docs/write-buffer-command-semantics-status.md` to record the literal
  command bit-source evidence without changing runtime behavior.
- Kept the unresolved write-buffer question queue unchanged because execution
  surface, buffer-full behavior, post-append clearing, and high-rail/state
  interaction still require later source-backed decisions.
- Verification passed: adjacent write-buffer and project-status tests ran 49
  tests; JSON formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; project
  status text and JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 8`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 590 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Resolved Resolution Questions

- Added ADR-0130 to expose source-status `resolved_resolution_questions` in
  project status JSON and text, so settled blocker questions are visible from
  the first diagnostic command.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 47 tests and failed because project status still reported
  `schema_version: 8`, omitted resolved-question JSON/text, and accepted
  malformed resolved-question metadata.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so accepted source-status entries
  carry `resolved_resolution_questions`, malformed resolved-question metadata
  fails as `source-status-schema`, and the default text report renders a
  `Resolved resolution questions:` section.
- Bumped project status JSON to `schema_version: 9`, carrying the
  standard-signal `command-table-offset` decision as settled by
  `sources/stem_command_buffer_map.json`.
- Verification passed: adjacent project-status and standard-signal tests ran
  54 tests; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; project status text and
  JSON were accepted at `schema_version: 9`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 594 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Resolved Question Source Paths

- Added ADR-0131 to require project-status resolved-question `source_status`
  paths to point at existing JSON object artifacts.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 50 tests and failed because missing, invalid-JSON, and
  non-object resolved-question source paths were still accepted.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so malformed resolved-question
  source paths reject the owning source-status record as `source-status-schema`
  while preserving project status JSON `schema_version: 9`.
- Verification passed: adjacent project-status and standard-signal tests ran
  57 tests; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; project status text and
  JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 9`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 597 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Resolved Question Details

- Added ADR-0132 to carry optional resolved-question details into project
  status JSON and text.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run executed 52 tests and failed because project status still reported
  `schema_version: 9`, omitted formal offset and legacy-divergence details, and
  accepted malformed optional detail metadata.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so resolved questions can expose
  `formal_command_offset` and `legacy_divergence`, render those details in the
  default text report, and fail malformed detail metadata as
  `source-status-schema`.
- Bumped project status JSON to `schema_version: 10`, carrying the
  standard-signal `command-table-offset` formal offset `0` and RAA legacy
  divergence.
- Verification passed: adjacent project-status and standard-signal tests ran
  59 tests; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; project status text and
  JSON were accepted at `schema_version: 10`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 599 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Predicate Result Certificates

- Added ADR-0133 to introduce `predicate-result` proof-certificate steps for
  transition claims.
- Updated proof-certificate tests before implementation. The red run executed
  9 tests and failed because the manifest had no `predicate-result` steps and
  `CertificateStep` could not carry predicate metadata.
- Updated object-language tests before implementation. The red run executed
  7 tests and failed because the certificate manifest used `predicate-result`
  while the transition-claim language still only allowed `manifest-example`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.proof_certificates` so `predicate-result` steps
  require a matching predicate name, still evaluate the claim predicate, and
  reject missing or mismatched predicate metadata.
- Updated `claims/proof_certificates.json` so the fixed-output preservation
  certificate uses `predicate-result`, and updated the transition object
  language to allow both `manifest-example` and `predicate-result`.
- Verification passed: adjacent proof-certificate and object-language tests
  ran 16 tests; JSON formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed;
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed 603 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Proof Certificate CLI

- Added ADR-0134 to expose transition proof-certificate validation through
  `python -m autarkic_systems.proof_certificates`.
- Updated proof-certificate tests before implementation. The red run executed
  16 tests and failed because the report builder, CLI runner, and module
  execution output did not exist.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.proof_certificates` with a project report, text and
  JSON formatting, `--claims` and `--certificates` path overrides, `--format`
  selection, and accepted/rejected exit codes.
- The default text command now reports 13 accepted transition proof
  certificates; JSON mode reports `accepted: true`, `claim_count: 13`,
  `certificate_count: 13`, and `result_count: 13`.
- Verification passed: focused proof-certificate tests ran 16 tests; JSON
  formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; proof-certificate
  text and JSON CLI output were accepted; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 610 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Transition Claim CLI

- Added ADR-0135 to expose base transition claim validation through
  `python -m autarkic_systems.claim_manifest`.
- Updated claim-manifest tests before implementation. The red run executed 11
  tests and failed because the report builder, CLI runner, and module
  execution output did not exist.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.claim_manifest` with a project report, text and
  JSON formatting, a `--claims` path override, `--format` selection, and
  accepted/mismatched exit codes.
- The default text command now reports 13 transition claims and 35 matched
  examples; JSON mode reports `accepted: true`, `claim_count: 13`,
  `example_count: 35`, `matched_count: 35`, and `result_count: 35`.
- Verification passed: focused claim-manifest tests ran 11 tests; JSON
  formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; transition-claim
  text and JSON CLI output were accepted; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 617 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Transition Object Language CLI

- Added ADR-0136 to expose the base transition object-language layer through
  `python -m autarkic_systems.object_language`.
- Updated object-language tests before implementation. The red run executed 14
  tests and failed because the report builder, CLI runner, and module
  execution output did not exist.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.object_language` with a project report, text and
  JSON formatting, `--language`, `--claims`, and `--certificates` path
  overrides, `--format` selection, and accepted/rejected exit codes.
- The default text command now reports the `as-transition-claim-v1` language
  surface; JSON mode reports `accepted: true`, `claim_count: 13`,
  `certificate_count: 13`, and `result_count: 63`.
- Verification passed: focused object-language tests ran 14 tests; JSON
  formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; object-language
  text and JSON CLI output were accepted; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 624 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Chain Object Language CLI

- Added ADR-0137 to expose the transition-chain object-language layer through
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_object_language`.
- Updated chain object-language tests before implementation. The red run
  executed 12 tests and failed because the report builder, CLI runner, and
  module execution output did not exist.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.chain_object_language` with a project report, text
  and JSON formatting, `--language`, `--claims`, and `--certificates` path
  overrides, `--format` selection, and accepted/rejected exit codes.
- The default text command now reports the `as-transition-chain-claim-v1`
  language surface; JSON mode reports `accepted: true`, `claim_count: 2`,
  `certificate_count: 2`, and `result_count: 32`.
- Verification passed: focused chain object-language tests ran 12 tests; JSON
  formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; chain
  object-language text and JSON CLI output were accepted; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 631 tests.

- Added ADR-0138 to include base and chain object-language summaries in
  `python -m autarkic_systems.project_status`.
- Updated project-status tests before implementation. The red run executed 52
  tests and failed because project status still reported `schema_version: 10`
  and omitted compact transition/chain language text lines.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so project status JSON includes
  `transition_language` and `chain_language` summaries with accepted state,
  paths, counts, failed subjects, result counts, and validation results.
- Added compact default text lines for transition and chain language status,
  added CLI path overrides for the language/claim/certificate manifests, and
  bumped project status JSON to `schema_version: 11`.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 52 tests; project
  status JSON was accepted at `schema_version: 11`; base and chain
  object-language JSON commands were accepted; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 631
  tests.

- Added ADR-0139 to render language failed-subject summaries in default
  project-status text while preserving project status JSON
  `schema_version: 11`.
- Updated project-status tests before implementation. The red run executed 54
  tests and failed because accepted text omitted `Language failures: none` and
  malformed base/chain language surfaces did not expose failed subjects in
  text.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` with compact language failure text
  lines for accepted and rejected language summaries.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 54 tests; project
  status text rendered `Language failures: none`; project status JSON remained
  accepted at `schema_version: 11`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check`
  passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 633 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Claim And Proof Surfaces

- Added ADR-0140 to include the base transition claim-example evaluator and
  proof-certificate verifier in `python -m autarkic_systems.project_status`.
- Updated project-status tests before implementation. The red run executed 56
  tests and failed because project status still reported `schema_version: 11`,
  omitted `transition_claims` and `transition_proof_certificates`, omitted
  compact accepted claim/proof text lines, and accepted broken claim/proof
  fixture paths.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so project status JSON includes
  `transition_claims` and `transition_proof_certificates` summaries with
  accepted state, paths, counts, failed subjects, result counts, and detailed
  validation results.
- Added compact default text lines for transition claims, transition proof
  certificates, and `Claim/proof failures:` failed-subject summaries, and
  bumped project status JSON to `schema_version: 12`.

  status text rendered accepted claim/proof summaries; project status JSON was
  accepted at `schema_version: 12`; direct claim/proof JSON CLIs were
  accepted; `py_compile` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 635
  tests.

- Added ADR-0141 to include the transition-chain claim validator in
  `python -m autarkic_systems.project_status`.
- Updated project-status tests before implementation. The red run executed 57
  tests and failed because project status still reported `schema_version: 12`,
  omitted `chain_claims`, omitted compact accepted chain-claim text lines, and
  accepted an incomplete chain proof-certificate fixture.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so project status JSON includes a
  `chain_claims` summary with accepted state, language ID, paths, counts,
  failed subjects, result count, and the existing chain validator results.
- Added compact default text for transition-chain claims and
  `Chain claim failures:` failed-subject summaries, and bumped project status
  JSON to `schema_version: 13`.

  status text rendered accepted chain-claim summaries; project status JSON was
  accepted at `schema_version: 13`; the direct chain-claim JSON CLI was
  accepted; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 636 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Standard-Signal Interaction Resolution

- Added ADR-0142 to move the write-buffer `standard-signal-interaction`
  question out of the unresolved queue because ADR-0129 already settled the
  source-backed bit-source fact: `write-buf-zero` and `write-buf-one` carry
  literal `0` and `1` bits rather than high-rail-derived values.
- Updated project-status and write-buffer source-status tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 64 tests and failed because
  `standard-signal-interaction` was still unresolved and
  `resolved_resolution_questions` was absent from the write-buffer artifact.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` and
  `docs/write-buffer-command-semantics-status.md` so project status shows the
  resolved write-buffer question while keeping recipient/stem surface,
  buffer-full behavior, and post-append clearing unresolved.
- Updated current-state docs to reflect that the unresolved write-buffer queue
  shrank for a semantic reason without changing Universal Cell runtime
  behavior.
- Verification passed: focused project-status and write-buffer tests ran 64
  tests; JSON formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; project
  status text and JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 13`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 637 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Self-Mailbox Resolution Detail

- Added ADR-0143 to expose the formal-model self-mailbox exception as a
  resolved standard-signal detail in project status.
- Updated standard-signal and project-status tests before implementation. The
  red run executed 65 tests and failed because
  `self-mailbox-standard-signal-binary-input-equivalence` was absent from
  `resolved_resolution_questions` and default status text.
- Updated `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` and
  `docs/standard-signal-command-semantics-status.md` so the first diagnostic
  report shows that stem self-mailbox `standard-signal` must not be treated as
  ordinary binary-input standard-signal behavior.
- Kept `self-target-surface` unresolved because this ADR does not choose the
  preserve, clear/no-op, or execution rule for command tokens.
- Verification passed: focused standard-signal and project-status tests ran 65
  tests; JSON formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; project
  status text and JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 13`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 638 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Resolution Question Evidence Surface

- Added ADR-0144 to expose source evidence for unresolved standard-signal and
  write-buffer resolution questions in project status.
- Updated project-status tests before implementation. The red run executed 60
  tests and failed because project status still reported `schema_version: 13`,
  omitted `resolution_question_evidence`, omitted `Resolution question
  evidence:` text, and accepted malformed evidence metadata.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so accepted source-status records
  carry `resolution_question_evidence` into JSON and default text, with
  fail-closed schema validation for malformed entries.
- Updated the standard-signal and write-buffer source-status records with
  evidence for each unresolved question, keeping runtime behavior unchanged.
- Verification passed: focused project-status tests ran 60 tests; JSON
  formatting, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed; project status text
  and JSON were accepted at `schema_version: 14`; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 641 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Source-Status Frontier CLI

- Added ADR-0145 to expose the blocked command-token source-status frontier as
  a direct text/JSON CLI.
- Updated source-status CLI tests before implementation. The red run failed
  because `autarkic_systems.source_status` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems.source_status` as a focused wrapper around the same
  source-status frontier validation used by project status.
- Documented the new `python -m autarkic_systems.source_status` operator
  command in README, project-status docs, and a dedicated frontier note.
- Verification passed: focused source-status CLI tests ran 9 tests;
  source-status text and JSON CLI output were accepted; project status text
  and JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 650
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Resolution Evidence Question Matching

- Added ADR-0146 to require `resolution_question_evidence` IDs to match live
  unresolved question IDs in the same source-status record.
- Updated project-status and source-status frontier tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 71 tests and failed because scratch
  records with a misspelled evidence question ID were still accepted.
- Updated the shared source-status frontier validator in
  `autarkic_systems.project_status` so unmatched evidence IDs reject the owning
  source-status record as `source-status-schema`.
- Verification passed: focused project-status and source-status frontier tests
  ran 71 tests; source-status JSON was accepted at `schema_version: 1`;
  project status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile`
  and `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 652
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Resolution Evidence Coverage

- Added ADR-0147 to require source-status `resolution_question_evidence` to
  cover every live unresolved question in the same record.
- Updated project-status and source-status frontier tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 74 tests and failed because scratch
  records with missing or partial evidence coverage were still accepted.
- Updated the shared source-status frontier validator in
  `autarkic_systems.project_status` so records with unresolved questions but
  missing or partial evidence coverage reject as `source-status-schema`.
- Verification passed: focused project-status and source-status frontier tests
  ran 74 tests; source-status JSON was accepted at `schema_version: 1`;
  project status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile`
  and `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 655
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Recipient Surface Resolution

- Added ADR-0148 to resolve the standard-signal `recipient-surface` question
  through the existing recipient non-init rejection boundary rather than
  widening command-token execution.
- Updated standard-signal, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The red run executed 83 tests and failed because
  `recipient-surface` was still unresolved and `recipient-command-message`
  still appeared as a blocked standard-signal runtime surface.
- Updated `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` and the
  standard-signal/recipient/frontier docs so delivered recipient
  `standard-signal` command messages point at
  `UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED`.
- Verification passed: focused standard-signal, project-status, and
  source-status frontier tests ran 83 tests; source-status JSON was accepted at
  `schema_version: 1` with standard-signal unresolved questions narrowed to
  `command-token-vs-binary-input` and `self-target-surface`; project-status
  JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 656
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Resolution Question Disjointness

- Added ADR-0149 to prevent source-status records from listing one
  `question_id` as both unresolved and resolved.
- Updated project-status and source-status frontier tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 76 tests and failed because a scratch
  record with overlapping `recipient-surface` entries was still accepted.
- Updated the shared source-status schema validator in
  `autarkic_systems.project_status` so overlapping unresolved/resolved
  question IDs reject as `source-status-schema`.
- Verification passed: focused project-status and source-status frontier tests
  ran 76 tests; source-status JSON was accepted at `schema_version: 1`;
  project-status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile`
  and `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 658
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Command Token Binary-Input Resolution

- Added ADR-0150 to resolve the standard-signal
  `command-token-vs-binary-input` question as a negative equivalence decision.
- Updated standard-signal, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The red run executed 86 tests and failed because
  `command-token-vs-binary-input` was still unresolved and absent from
  `resolved_resolution_questions`.
- Updated `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` so
  command-token `standard-signal` no longer inherits ordinary binary-input
  standard-signal behavior by default.
- Verification passed: focused standard-signal, project-status, and
  source-status frontier tests ran 86 tests; source-status JSON was accepted at
  `schema_version: 1` with only `self-target-surface` unresolved for
  standard-signal; project-status JSON remained accepted at
  `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 659 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Self-Target Resolution

- Added ADR-0151 to resolve the remaining standard-signal
  `self-target-surface` question through existing unsupported preservation
  boundaries.
- Updated standard-signal, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The red run executed 87 tests and failed because
  `self-target-surface` was still unresolved and absent from
  `resolved_resolution_questions`.
- Updated `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` and the
  self-mailbox/command-buffer unsupported evidence bundle boundaries so
  standard-signal self-target behavior points at the existing preservation
  claims.
- Verification passed: focused standard-signal, project-status, source-status
  frontier, and unsupported evidence-bundle tests ran 99 tests; the evidence
  bundle registry accepted all 8 bundles; source-status JSON was accepted at
  `schema_version: 1` with no unresolved standard-signal questions;
  project-status JSON remained accepted at `schema_version: 14`; `py_compile`
  and `git diff --check` passed; and `python -m unittest discover` passed 660
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Recipient Surface Resolution

- Added ADR-0152 to resolve delivered recipient write-buffer command messages
  through the existing recipient non-init rejection boundary.
- Updated write-buffer, project-status, and source-status frontier tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 84 tests and failed because
  `recipient-vs-stem-surface` was still unresolved, recipient command-message
  remained a blocked write-buffer surface, and `recipient-surface` was absent
  from write-buffer resolved questions.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` so write-buffer
  unresolved surface work is narrowed to `self-target-surface`.
- Focused verification passed 84 tests. `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`
  parsed as JSON. Source-status JSON accepted schema 1 with write-buffer
  unresolved questions narrowed to `self-target-surface`,
  `buffer-full-boundary`, and `post-append-clearing`, and with
  `recipient-surface` resolved. Project-status JSON accepted schema 14 with
  write-buffer blocked runtime surfaces narrowed to `self-mailbox-command` and
  `self-target-command-buffer`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 661 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Self-Target Surface Resolution

- Added ADR-0153 to resolve write-buffer self-target surface handling through
  the existing unsupported self-mailbox and self-target command-buffer
  boundaries.
- Updated write-buffer, project-status, and source-status frontier tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 85 tests and failed because
  `self-target-surface` was still unresolved and absent from write-buffer
  `resolved_resolution_questions`.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` so
  `self-target-surface` is resolved as
  `preserve-self-target-write-buffer-as-unsupported`, leaving only
  `buffer-full-boundary` and `post-append-clearing` unresolved.
- Updated the self-mailbox unsupported and command-buffer unsupported evidence
  bundle boundary text to record that write-buffer self-target surfaces are
  unsupported-preserved while append execution semantics remain source-blocked.
- Focused verification passed 97 tests. The evidence bundle registry accepted
  all 8 bundles. Source-status JSON accepted schema 1 and project-status JSON
  accepted schema 14 with the narrowed write-buffer frontier. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 662 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Source-Status Execution Readiness Gate

- Added ADR-0154 to expose command-token execution readiness as a
  machine-checkable source-status field instead of relying on prose.
- Updated project-status and source-status frontier tests before
  implementation. The red run executed 80 tests and failed because schema
  versions were still old, readiness text was absent, and malformed readiness
  fixtures were accepted.
- Added `execution_readiness` extraction, rendering, and fail-closed schema
  validation to the shared project-status frontier path, and exposed it through
  the focused source-status CLI.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` so write-buffer
  append execution is explicitly `blocked`, with execution changes disallowed
  until `buffer-full-boundary` and `post-append-clearing` are resolved.
- Verification passed: focused project-status and source-status frontier tests
  ran 80 tests; source-status JSON accepted schema 2 with write-buffer
  execution readiness blocked by `buffer-full-boundary` and
  `post-append-clearing`; project-status JSON accepted schema 15 with the same
  readiness payload; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed; and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 666 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Execution Readiness Coverage

- Added ADR-0155 to require blocked execution-readiness gates to cover every
  live unresolved `required_resolution_questions` ID.
- Added the red project-status schema fixture before implementation. The red
  run executed 81 focused tests and failed only that new fixture because the
  validator accepted a blocked readiness gate that named only one of two live
  blockers.
- Tightened source-status schema validation so blocked readiness
  `blocked_by_resolution_questions` must cover all live unresolved questions.
- Focused verification passed 81 tests. Project-status remains schema 15 and
  source-status frontier remains schema 2; this is a validation-only change.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 667 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Execution Readiness Allowed-Question Guard

- Added ADR-0156 to reject execution-readiness records that allow execution
  changes while unresolved `required_resolution_questions` remain.
- Added the red project-status schema fixture before implementation. The red
  run executed 82 focused tests and failed only that new fixture because the
  validator accepted `execution_change_allowed: true` beside a live blocker.
- Tightened source-status schema validation so readiness cannot allow
  execution changes until the unresolved question list is empty.
- Focused verification passed 82 tests. Project-status remains schema 15 and
  source-status frontier remains schema 2; this is a validation-only change.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 668 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Execution Readiness Blocked Consistency

- Added ADR-0157 to reject contradictory readiness metadata where
  `execution_readiness.decision` is `blocked` but execution changes are
  allowed.
- Added the red project-status schema fixture before implementation. The red
  run executed 83 focused tests and failed only that new fixture because the
  validator accepted the contradictory readiness record.
- Tightened source-status schema validation so blocked readiness cannot allow
  execution changes.
- Focused verification passed 83 tests. Project-status remains schema 15 and
  source-status frontier remains schema 2; this is a validation-only change.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 669 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Resolution Question ID Uniqueness

- Added ADR-0158 to reject duplicate unresolved and duplicate resolved
  source-status question IDs within a single source-status record.
- Added the red project-status schema fixtures before implementation. The red
  run executed the two new tests and failed because duplicate live and settled
  `question_id` values were accepted.
- Tightened source-status schema validation so
  `required_resolution_questions[].question_id` and
  `resolved_resolution_questions[].question_id` are each unique inside their
  own list.
- Focused verification passed 85 tests. Project-status remains schema 15 and
  source-status frontier remains schema 2; this is a validation-only change.
  The source-status and project-status JSON CLIs accepted their current
  schemas. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 671 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Full-Boundary Resolution

- Added ADR-0159 to resolve the write-buffer `buffer-full-boundary` question
  without widening runtime execution.
- Added red write-buffer, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The focused red run executed 96 tests and failed
  because `buffer-full-boundary` was still unresolved, absent from
  `resolved_resolution_questions`, and still present in execution-readiness
  blockers.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` with a
  structured `buffer_full_boundary_resolution`, moved `buffer-full-boundary`
  to resolved questions, and narrowed the live unresolved queue and readiness
  blocker list to `post-append-clearing`.
- Focused verification passed 97 tests. Project-status remains schema 15 and
  source-status frontier remains schema 2; this is a source-status-only
  narrowing with no Universal Cell runtime behavior change. The source-status
  and project-status JSON CLIs accepted the narrowed write-buffer blocker list.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 674 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Post-Append Resolution

- Added ADR-0160 to resolve the final write-buffer `post-append-clearing`
  question without widening runtime execution.
- Added red write-buffer, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The focused red run executed 99 tests and failed
  because `post-append-clearing` was still unresolved, absent from
  `resolved_resolution_questions`, and still blocked execution readiness.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` with a
  structured `post_append_clearing_resolution`, moved
  `post-append-clearing` to resolved questions, emptied the live write-buffer
  unresolved queue, and marked write-buffer append execution source-ready for
  a later implementation ADR.
- Focused verification passed 99 tests, and the adjacent stale multi-command
  status assertion was updated to the new write-buffer safe-next slice.
  Source-status JSON accepted schema 2 with write-buffer ready; project-status
  JSON accepted schema 15 with the same readiness. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 676 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Command Execution

- Added ADR-0161 to implement the source-ready write-buffer append slice for
  direct stem `self_mailbox` commands and completed self-target command
  buffers.
- Added red runtime and claim tests before implementation. The focused red run
  failed because write-buffer commands still reported the old unsupported
  boundaries, the new predicates/statuses were absent, and the unsupported
  evidence bundles still covered write-buffer examples.
- Implemented `write-buf-zero` / `write-buf-one` append behavior in
  `step_stem_cell`: direct self-mailbox commands append literal bits and clear
  `self_mailbox`; completed self-target command buffers append the decoded
  literal as the new buffer content and clear the command source. Recipient
  write-buffer command-message inputs remain rejected by the recipient non-init
  boundary.
- Added explicit write-buffer transition predicates, transition claims, proof
  certificates, language terms, and status vocabulary. Narrowed the old
  self-mailbox and command-buffer unsupported examples, traces, SVGs, and
  evidence bundles to `standard-signal`.
- Updated source-status, project-status, roadmap, and evidence documentation
  so write-buffer self-target execution is marked implemented while delivered
  recipient write-buffer command messages remain blocked.
- Focused verification passed for the write-buffer runtime/claim/status and
  evidence/source-status suites. Project status reports schema 15 accepted
  with 15 transition claims, 37 matched examples, 15 proof certificates, and
  write-buffer readiness `implemented`. The transition/chain evidence
  registries, source-status and project-status CLIs, `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 687 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Write-Buffer Execution Evidence Bundles

- Added ADR-0162 to register the ADR-0161 write-buffer execution surfaces as
  integrated evidence bundles without changing runtime behavior.
- Added red trace, SVG, evidence-bundle, registry, source-status, and
  project-status tests before implementation. The focused red run executed
  152 tests and failed because the new trace IDs, SVG constants, bundle files,
  registry entries, and updated write-buffer safe-next slice were absent.
- Added schematic trace validation and SVG rendering support for direct
  self-mailbox write-buffer append and completed self-target command-buffer
  write-buffer append.
- Added `schematics/self_mailbox_write_buffer_trace.json`,
  `schematics/self_command_buffer_write_buffer_trace.json`, and the matching
  renderer-generated SVG artifacts.
- Added `evidence/self_mailbox_write_buffer_bundle.json` and
  `evidence/self_command_buffer_write_buffer_bundle.json`, registered both in
  `evidence/manifest.json`, and updated status/docs so transition evidence now
  contains ten bundles.
- Updated write-buffer source-status safe-next from the completed evidence
  task to recipient write-buffer command-message source resolution.
- Focused verification passed 178 tests. Project status remains schema 15 and
  source-status frontier remains schema 2; this is an evidence/documentation
  slice with no Universal Cell runtime behavior change. The evidence registry
  accepted 10 transition bundles, source/project status JSON passed,
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 728 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Recipient Write-Buffer Rejection Coverage

- Added ADR-0163 to make delivered recipient write-buffer rejection explicit
  in the existing recipient non-init claim/proof/evidence surface without
  changing runtime behavior.
- Added red claim, evidence-bundle, registry, and project-status tests before
  implementation. The focused red run executed 107 tests and failed because
  upstream `write-buf-zero` / `write-buf-one` rejection examples were absent
  from the claim manifest, proof certificate, and recipient non-init bundle
  coverage.
- Added positive upstream write-buffer rejection examples to
  `UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED`, added matching
  proof-certificate steps, and expanded
  `evidence/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_bundle.json` covered examples
  while keeping the primary trace/SVG as the upstream `standard-signal`
  rejection witness.
- Updated recipient and write-buffer source-status artifacts and docs so the
  remaining recipient write-buffer frontier is source semantics, not missing
  claim/proof coverage.
- Focused green verification passed 107 tests and adjacent source-status
  verification passed 138 tests. The evidence registry accepted 10 transition
  bundles; project status reports schema 15 with 15 transition claims and 39
  matched examples; source-status frontier reports schema 2. JSON parsing,
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 730 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Neighbor Write-Buffer Zero Rejection Chain Coverage

- Added ADR-0164 to make the composed neighbor-delivery rejection chain
  explicit for delivered `write-buf-zero` as well as the existing
  `write-buf-one` path.
- Added red chain-helper, chain-claim, chain-claim CLI, and project-status
  tests before implementation. The focused red run executed 93 tests and
  failed because the `write-buf-zero` chain examples were absent from the
  chain claim/proof manifests and CLI/status reports still counted seven
  examples.
- Added a negative consumed-chain example and a positive rejected-chain example
  for completed neighbor-c `write-buf-zero` delivery, plus matching
  proof-certificate steps.
- Runtime behavior, chain traces, SVGs, and chain evidence bundles remain
  unchanged; this is a claim/proof coverage slice over existing chain helper
  behavior.
- Focused green verification passed 93 tests and adjacent chain/object-language
  verification passed 105 tests. Chain-claim JSON accepted two claims and nine
  evaluated examples; project-status JSON accepted schema 15 with the same
  chain coverage. JSON parsing, `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 731 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Execution Readiness Boundary

- Added ADR-0165 to remove an operator ambiguity in the standard-signal
  source-status record: no live resolution questions means the unsupported
  boundary is settled, not that command-token execution should be implemented.
- Added red standard-signal, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The red full-suite check failed because
  `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` lacked
  `execution_readiness`, and text/JSON reports therefore omitted the
  standard-signal readiness line.
- Added `execution_readiness.decision: preserved-unsupported` to the
  standard-signal source-status record, with execution changes disallowed and
  no unresolved-question blockers.
- Runtime behavior, claims, proof certificates, traces, SVGs, and evidence
  bundles remain unchanged; this is a source-status and operator-reporting
  boundary slice.
- Focused green verification passed 97 tests. Project-status remains schema
  15 and source-status frontier remains schema 2. JSON parsing, `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full
  suite ran 732 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Safe-Next Boundary

- Added ADR-0166 to align safe-next wording with the ADR-0165
  standard-signal preserved-unsupported readiness boundary.
- Added red standard-signal, recipient non-init, multi-command,
  write-buffer, project-status, and source-status frontier tests before
  changing source-status records. The focused red run executed 120 tests and
  failed because the old combined
  `revisit-standard-signal-or-write-buffer-command-semantics` string still
  appeared in checked source-status records and reports.
- Updated standard-signal safe-next wording to require new source evidence
  before an execution change, and moved recipient non-init plus multi-command
  safe-next pointers to recipient write-buffer command-message semantics.
- Runtime behavior, claims, proof certificates, traces, SVGs, evidence
  bundles, and schema versions remain unchanged.
- Focused green verification passed 120 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Recipient Write-Buffer Readiness Question

- Added ADR-0167 to make the remaining recipient write-buffer
  command-message surface a live source-status question instead of letting
  write-buffer readiness look broadly implemented.
- Added red write-buffer, project-status, and source-status frontier tests
  before implementation. The focused red run executed 99 tests and failed
  because write-buffer source status had no
  `recipient-command-message-surface` question and still reported readiness
  as `implemented`.
- Added `recipient-command-message-surface` with matching evidence to
  `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`. The evidence records
  formal-model and RAA/FSMSIM pressure toward input-channel append behavior,
  the existing AS recipient rejection boundary, and the remaining SEMSIM
  post-append clearing divergence.
- Changed write-buffer execution readiness to
  `self-target-implemented-recipient-blocked`, with execution changes
  disallowed until that recipient question is resolved.
- Runtime behavior, claims, proof certificates, traces, SVGs, evidence
  bundles, and schema versions remain unchanged.
- Focused green verification passed 99 tests. Project-status JSON accepted
  schema 15 with the new recipient question; source-status JSON accepted
  schema 2 with the same question. JSON parsing, `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full
  suite ran 732 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Recipient Write-Buffer Surface Resolution

- Added ADR-0168 to resolve the live
  `recipient-command-message-surface` question as
  `execute-recipient-write-buffer-command-message-append`.
- Added red write-buffer, project-status, source-status frontier, recipient
  non-init, recipient command-consumption, multi-command, and standard-signal
  frontier tests before changing the source-status records. The focused red
  run executed 126 tests and failed because the old write-buffer status still
  listed the recipient question as unresolved, blocked execution readiness,
  and pointed safe-next guidance at semantics rather than implementation.
- Updated `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` so the
  recipient command-message surface is source-ready, has no live required
  resolution questions, and exposes
  `execution_readiness.decision:
  recipient-command-message-source-ready`.
- Updated recipient-facing source-status records to preserve the checked
  current runtime rejection boundary while moving the safe next slice to
  recipient write-buffer command-message implementation.
- Runtime behavior, claims, proof certificates, traces, SVGs, evidence
  bundles, and schema versions remain unchanged.
- Focused green verification passed 137 tests after including the adjacent
  stem source-status expectation. Project-status JSON accepted schema 15 with
  source-ready write-buffer readiness; source-status JSON accepted schema 2
  with no live resolution questions. JSON parsing, `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full
  suite ran 733 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Recipient Write-Buffer Command Execution

- Added ADR-0169 to implement recipient-side `write-buf-zero` and
  `write-buf-one` command-message execution after ADR-0168 resolved the source
  boundary as append-ready.
- Added red runtime, claim/proof/language, chain, and status tests before
  implementation. The focused red run executed 151 tests and failed because
  recipient write-buffer command messages still rejected, the append status and
  predicate were absent, write-buffer still appeared in blocked command
  reports, and chain/evidence manifests still represented delivered
  write-buffer as rejection behavior.
- Implemented recipient write-buffer command-message append behavior in the
  universal-cell transition path, preserving the full-buffer boundary and
  leaving single `standard-signal` plus multi-command conflicts rejected.
- Added `UC-RECIPIENT-WRITE-BUFFER-COMMAND-MESSAGE-APPENDED` with predicate,
  proof certificate, object-language entries, and focused tests; removed single
  write-buffer inputs from the recipient non-init rejection claim and evidence
  bundle.
- Updated neighbor-delivery chain claims so delivered write-buffer commands
  are consumed by recipient append behavior, while delivered `standard-signal`
  remains the rejection-chain witness.
- Updated source-status and project-status reports so `standard-signal` is the
  only remaining blocked command and write-buffer safe-next guidance points to
  evidence-bundle promotion.
- Focused green verification passed 230 tests. Project-status JSON accepted
  schema 15 with 16 transition claims and 40 evaluated examples; source-status
  JSON accepted schema 2; transition and chain evidence registries accepted 10
  and 2 bundles respectively. JSON parsing, `compileall`, `git diff --check`,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 744 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Recipient Write-Buffer Command Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0170 to promote ADR-0169 recipient write-buffer command-message
  append behavior into the transition evidence registry.
- Added red trace, SVG, evidence-bundle, registry, and status tests before
  implementation. The focused red run executed 149 tests and failed because
  the recipient write-buffer trace/SVG constants and files were absent, the
  bundle was unregistered, and source-status records still advertised the
  pending write-buffer evidence-bundle promotion.
- Added `schematics/recipient_write_buffer_command_message_trace.json` for an
  upstream `write-buf-zero` recipient append, plus the matching renderer-locked
  SVG.
- Added
  `evidence/recipient_write_buffer_command_message_bundle.json`, covering both
  positive recipient write-buffer command-message examples while tracing the
  upstream zero append case.
- Updated the transition evidence registry from 10 to 11 bundles and taught
  the schematic trace/SVG validators the new recipient write-buffer trace
  artifact.
- Updated write-buffer, recipient non-init, recipient command-consumption,
  multi-command, and stem source-status records so the completed write-buffer
  evidence promotion no longer appears as an active safe-next frontier.
- Focused green verification passed 183 tests. Transition evidence accepted 11
  bundles, chain evidence accepted 2 bundles, project-status JSON accepted
  schema 15 with 16 transition claims and 40 evaluated examples, and
  source-status JSON accepted schema 2 with only `standard-signal` blocked.
  JSON parsing, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 763 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Standard-Signal Source Review Snapshot

- Added ADR-0171 to perform the remaining standard-signal command-token
  source-review gate before any execution change.
- Added red source-review, standard-signal, recipient non-init, multi-command,
  project-status, and source-status tests before implementation. The focused
  red run executed 112 tests and failed because the source-review snapshot was
  absent, the standard-signal status lacked a latest-review link, and source
  statuses still advertised the review as an active safe-next slice.
- Checked upstream source heads with `git ls-remote`: AS, AFS, PRC, SJAS,
  Proflog, and LeanTAP matched the pinned manifest heads. The local PRC
  witness remained at `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
- Added `sources/standard_signal_source_review_status.json`, recording that no
  reviewed source replaces the existing unsupported standard-signal
  command-token boundary.
- Updated standard-signal, recipient non-init, multi-command, and recipient
  command-consumption source-status records so standard-signal remains blocked
  behind `no-standard-signal-command-token-execution-change-without-new-source-evidence`
  rather than an active source-review safe-next slice.
- Focused green verification passed 132 tests. Project-status JSON accepted
  schema 15 with `standard-signal` as the only blocked command and no active
  aggregate safe-next slice; source-status JSON accepted schema 2 with the
  same frontier. Transition and chain evidence registries accepted 11 and 2
  bundles respectively. JSON parsing, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 769 tests.

- Added ADR-0172 to migrate
  `UC-FIXED-CONSUMED-INPUT-CLEARED` from `manifest-example` proof steps to
  explicit `predicate-result` proof steps.
- Added red proof-certificate and project-status tests before implementation.
  The focused red run executed 90 tests and failed because the consumed-input
  certificate still used `manifest-example`, and proof/project-status reports
  still described it as two `manifest-example` steps.
- Updated `claims/proof_certificates.json` so both consumed-input certificate
  steps use `predicate-result` and name `consumed_input_cleared` directly.
- Focused green verification passed 90 tests. The proof-certificate CLI JSON,
  project-status JSON, and object-language JSON checks accepted the updated
  certificate surface. JSON parsing for the touched certificate manifest,

  proof steps to explicit `predicate-result` proof steps.
- Added red proof-certificate and project-status tests before implementation.
  The focused red run executed 104 tests and failed because the recipient
  non-init command-message certificate still used `manifest-example`, because

- Added ADR-0187 to extend `predicate-result` proof steps to the transition-chain
  claim surface.
- Added red chain-claim, chain-CLI, chain-object-language, and project-status
  tests before implementation. The focused red run executed 104 tests and failed
  because the chain verifier rejected `predicate-result`, the chain language only
  admitted `manifest-example`, the checked chain certificates still used
  `manifest-example`, and project status still reported 28 chain language
  clauses.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/chain_claims.py` so chain certificates accept
  `predicate-result` steps, require predicate metadata, reject mismatched
  predicate names, verify predicate result names, and report per-rule step
  counts.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/chain_object_language.py` and
  `language/transition_chain_claim_language.json` so the chain proof-object
  language admits both `manifest-example` and `predicate-result`.
- Updated `claims/transition_chain_proof_certificates.json` so both checked
  chain certificates use `predicate-result` steps that name
  `neighbor_delivery_consumed_by_recipient` or
  `neighbor_delivery_rejected_by_recipient` directly.
- Focused green verification passed 104 tests. The chain-claim CLI JSON,
  chain object-language CLI JSON, and project-status JSON checks accepted the
  updated surface. JSON parsing for the touched chain proof-certificate and
  language manifests, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, a direct no
  `manifest-example` chain-certificate guard, and `python -m unittest discover`
  passed; the full suite ran 788 tests.

  `schema_version: 15`, had no `proof_rule_audit` JSON payload, and did not
  render a proof-rule text line.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` so project status loads the
  checked transition and transition-chain certificate manifests through the
  existing proof-certificate loader, counts proof steps by rule, reports
  transition, chain, and combined counts, and rejects missing or malformed audit
  sources with source-specific failed subjects.
- Bumped project status to `schema_version: 16` and added the text line
  `Proof rule audit: predicate-result=49, manifest-example=0` for the current
  checked manifests.
- Focused green verification passed 74 tests. The text and JSON project-status
  commands accepted the updated surface. JSON parsing for both checked
  proof-certificate manifests, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 789 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Compact Project Status Summary

- Added ADR-0189 to add a compact operator-facing status digest over the
  existing project-status payload.
- Added red project-status tests before implementation. The focused red run
  executed 76 tests and failed because `format_project_status_summary` did not
  exist and `--format summary` was rejected by the CLI parser.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` with
  `format_project_status_summary` and `--format summary`, preserving the JSON
  schema and full text report while rendering accepted state, evidence counts,
  claim counts, proof-rule counts, blocked commands, and safe next slice in six
  lines.
- Focused green verification passed 76 tests. The summary CLI printed the
  compact digest and omitted evidence bundle listings and source-status
  boundary paragraphs. Summary and JSON project-status commands, `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 791 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - GitHub Submission Status

- Added ADR-0190 to make local GitHub submission evidence visible from a
  command rather than raw git inspection.
- Added red GitHub submission status tests before implementation. The focused
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.github_submission` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` with text/JSON output over the
  current branch, `HEAD`, origin/fork remote URLs, fork `main` match state,
  origin `main` divergence counts, and the upstream tracking issue URL.
- Focused green verification passed 5 tests. Live text and JSON runs reported
  the current `HEAD` as submitted to fork `main` before this ADR was committed.
  Project-status summary, submission-status JSON, `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 796 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - End-Of-Month Handoff Status

- Added ADR-0191 to combine compact project status and GitHub submission
  evidence into one local handoff command.
- Added red handoff tests before implementation. The focused red run failed
  because `autarkic_systems.handoff` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/handoff.py` with text/JSON output over the existing
  project-status and GitHub-submission reports. The handoff state is ready only
  when the project status is accepted and the current `HEAD` is visible on fork
  `main`.
- Focused green verification passed 5 tests. Live text and JSON handoff runs
  accepted the current project status and GitHub submission state before this
  ADR was committed. Handoff text/JSON, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 801 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Submission Ref Freshness

- Added ADR-0192 to make the local freshness of fork submission evidence
  explicit in GitHub submission and handoff reports.
- Added red GitHub-submission and handoff tests before implementation. The
  focused red run failed because submission status did not accept freshness
  metadata, did not accept a clock, and had no freshness text/JSON fields.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` to read
  `refs/remotes/fork/main` from the local git reflog, classify the ref as fresh
  or stale against a configurable freshness window, and expose that field in
  text and JSON output.
- Focused green verification passed 11 tests. Live submission and handoff
  text/JSON commands reported `fork/main` freshness as fresh before this ADR
  was committed. `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 802 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Refresh Remotes Before Handoff

- Added ADR-0193 to let operators explicitly refresh inspected
  remote-tracking refs before submission or handoff status is rendered.
- Added red GitHub-submission and handoff tests before implementation. The
  focused red run failed because `--refresh-remotes` was not accepted,
  submission status did not accept `refresh_remotes`, handoff had no submission
  runner injection, and the payload had no `remote_refresh` field.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` so requested refreshes fetch
  fork `main` into `refs/remotes/fork/main` and origin `main` into
  `refs/remotes/origin/main` before reporting. Refresh results now appear in
  text and JSON, and requested refresh failures reject submission status.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/handoff.py` with `--refresh-remotes`, threaded into
  the submission report before handoff readiness is computed.
- Focused green verification passed 14 tests. Live
  `github_submission --refresh-remotes` and `handoff --refresh-remotes` runs
  both reported `Remote refresh: accepted (fork/main, origin/main)` before this
  ADR was committed. `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 805 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Two-Cell Network Witness

- Added ADR-0194 to make the existing neighbor-delivery chain inspectable as a
  bounded network-shaped execution witness rather than only as a predicate
  helper.
- Added red witness tests before implementation. The focused red run failed
  because `autarkic_systems.network_witness` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/network_witness.py`, which delegates execution to the
  existing neighbor-delivery chain helper and records sender before/after
  state, recipient before/before-step/after state, installed delivered tuple,
  and ordered sender/handoff/recipient events.
- Added text and JSON output plus named CLI fixture cases for consumed init
  delivery, consumed write-buffer delivery, and rejected standard-signal
  delivery.
- Focused green verification passed 9 tests. The write-buffer JSON fixture
  reported delivered `write-buf-one` and recipient buffer `[1]`. `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 814 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Complete Network Witness Fixture Surface

- Added ADR-0195 to expose the failure-shape witnesses through the same CLI as
  the consumed/rejected delivery fixtures.
- Added red witness tests first. The focused red run failed because
  `recipient-not-ready` and `sender-not-delivered` were invalid `--case`
  choices.
- Added `recipient-not-ready` and `sender-not-delivered` fixture constructors
  to `autarkic_systems/network_witness.py` and updated
  `docs/two-cell-network-witness.md` so all five checked witness shapes are
  listed for operators.
- Focused green verification passed 11 tests. Live JSON/text runs for the two
  new failure fixtures emitted the expected witness payloads with nonzero
  rejected-witness exits. `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 816 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Post-Handoff Signal Witness

- Added ADR-0196 to show one durable recipient behavior after an accepted
  init-family neighbor-delivery handoff.
- Added red post-handoff witness tests before implementation. The focused red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.network_sequence` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/network_sequence.py`, composing the existing two-cell
  network witness with one explicit recipient follow-up input and the existing
  fixed/stem transition functions.
- The accepted fixture delivers `proc-l-init`, observes the recipient as
  `proc/left`, applies binary follow-up input `(1, 0, 0)`, and records routed
  output `(0, 0, 1)` with processor memory toggled to `right`.
- Added rejected fixtures for consumed non-init handoff and malformed follow-up
  input, plus operator notes in `docs/post-handoff-signal-witness.md`.
- Focused green verification passed 7 tests. Live JSON/text runs for accepted
  and malformed-follow-up fixtures exposed the expected sequence status and
  recipient final state. `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 823 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Post-Handoff Sequence Claim

- Added ADR-0197 to name the ADR-0196 post-handoff signal witness as a checked
  claim surface before any later evidence-bundle promotion.
- Added red sequence-claim tests before implementation. The focused red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.network_sequence_claims` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_predicates.py` with
  `post_handoff_signal_routed`, checking the accepted `proc-l-init` handoff,
  follow-up input `(1, 0, 0)`, routed output `(0, 0, 1)`, processor memory
  toggle to `right`, and cleared recipient input.
- Added `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_claims.py` plus
  `claims/network_sequence_claims.json` and
  `claims/network_sequence_proof_certificates.json`, with one positive
  post-handoff routing example and two negative examples.
- Focused green verification passed 10 tests. The validator rejects incomplete
  certificate manifests and exposes text/JSON CLI output.

## 2026-05-18 - Network Sequence Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0198 to make the post-handoff sequence claim discoverable as a
  checked evidence bundle.
- Added red evidence-bundle tests before implementation. The focused red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.network_sequence_evidence_bundle` did not
  exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_evidence_bundle.py`,
  `evidence/sequences/post_handoff_signal_bundle.json`, and
  `evidence/sequences/manifest.json`.
- The bundle validator checks the sequence claim example, predicate-result
  proof certificate, executable witness status, underlying registered
  neighbor-delivery chain evidence bundle, referenced source-status files, and
  explicit boundary text.
- Focused green verification passed 10 tests. Bundle and registry CLIs expose
  text/JSON validation for the new evidence surface. `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 843 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Sequence Evidence

- Added ADR-0199 to fold the checked network-sequence evidence registry into
  aggregate project status.
- Added red project-status tests before implementation. The focused red run
  executed 78 tests and failed because project status still reported schema
  version `16`, had no `sequence_evidence`, omitted sequence evidence from
  text/summary output, rejected `--sequence-registry`, and did not accept a
  `sequence_registry_path` builder override.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` to validate
  `evidence/sequences/manifest.json`, expose `sequence_evidence`, include that
  registry in aggregate acceptance, render the one sequence bundle in text and
  summary output, and report missing sequence registries as structured
  `registry-file` failures.
- Focused green verification passed 78 project-status tests after
  implementation. The first full regression run exposed stale handoff test
  fixtures that lacked `sequence_evidence`; after updating that fixture,
  focused handoff tests, focused project-status tests, `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, live project-status text/summary/JSON checks, refreshed
  handoff, and `python -m unittest discover` passed. The full suite ran 845
  tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Sequence Claims

- Added ADR-0200 to fold the network-sequence claim/proof surface into
  aggregate project status after ADR-0199 added the sequence evidence registry.
- Added red project-status tests before implementation. The focused red run
  executed 81 tests and failed because project status still reported schema
  version `17`, had no `sequence_claims`, omitted sequence claims from
  text/summary output, kept the proof-rule audit at 49 predicate-result steps,
  rejected `--sequence-claims` / `--sequence-certificates`, and did not accept
  `sequence_claims_path` or `sequence_certificates_path` builder overrides.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` to validate
  `claims/network_sequence_claims.json` and
  `claims/network_sequence_proof_certificates.json`, expose `sequence_claims`,
  include that surface in aggregate acceptance, include sequence certificate
  steps in the proof-rule audit, and report missing sequence claim/certificate
  manifests as structured failures.
- Focused green verification passed 81 project-status tests and 6 handoff
  tests. Live project-status summary reported `1 sequence claim/1 certificate`
  and proof rules `predicate-result=52, manifest-example=0`; JSON reported
  schema version `18` and accepted sequence claims. `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, refreshed handoff, and `python -m unittest discover`
  passed; the full suite ran 848 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Network Sequence Object Language

- Added ADR-0201 to make the network-sequence claim syntax explicit.
- Added red object-language tests before implementation. The focused red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.network_sequence_object_language` and
  `language/network_sequence_claim_language.json` did not exist.
- Added `language/network_sequence_claim_language.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_object_language.py`, validating required
  syntax classes, roles, memory, signal vocabulary, automail, command messages,
  transition statuses, chain statuses, sequence statuses, cell fields,
  predicate symbols, sentence prefixes, proof-object rules, manifest pointers,
  and the checked sequence claim/proof surface.
- Focused green verification passed 12 sequence object-language tests.
  Adjacent sequence object-language/claims/evidence tests passed 32 tests. The
  sequence object-language JSON CLI reported accepted
  `as-network-sequence-claim-v1` with one claim and one certificate.
  `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed;
  the full suite ran 860 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Sequence Language

- Added ADR-0202 to fold the network-sequence object-language surface into
  aggregate project status.
- Added red project-status tests before implementation. The focused red run
  executed 83 tests and failed because project status still reported schema
  version `18`, had no `sequence_language`, omitted sequence language from text
  output, omitted sequence-language failures, rejected `--sequence-language`,
  and did not accept a `sequence_language_path` builder override.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` to validate
  `language/network_sequence_claim_language.json`, expose `sequence_language`,
  include that surface in aggregate acceptance, render the sequence language in
  default text output, and report sequence-language failed subjects through the
  shared language failure section.
- Focused green verification passed 83 project-status tests. Adjacent
  project-status plus sequence object-language tests passed 95 tests. Live
  JSON output reported schema version `19` and accepted sequence language with
  32 validation results; text output reported `Network sequence language:
  accepted (1 claim, 1 certificate)` and `Language failures: none`.
  `compileall`, `git diff --check`, refreshed handoff, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 862 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Sequence Evidence Language Link

- Added ADR-0203 to make the post-handoff sequence evidence bundle cite and
  validate the checked network-sequence object language.
- Added red evidence-bundle tests before implementation. The focused red run
  failed because loaded bundles had no `sequence_language_path`, the validation
  result set lacked `sequence-language`, missing language paths were not
  rejected by bundle validation, and reports lacked `OK sequence-language:`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_evidence_bundle.py` to load a
  `sequence_language` artifact, include it in schema path validation, validate
  it through the existing network-sequence object-language validator, and
  report a dedicated `sequence-language` result.
- Updated `evidence/sequences/post_handoff_signal_bundle.json` to cite
  `language/network_sequence_claim_language.json`.

  over the existing network-sequence evidence-bundle validators.
- The demo report exposes accepted status, validation failed subjects, evidence
  layers, artifact-presence flags, missing evidence paths, source-status
  boundaries, explicit boundary terms, and registry summaries without adding
  new validation authority.
- Focused green verification passed 13 network sequence demo-report tests.
  Adjacent demo/evidence/language/claim tests passed 46 tests. Live text output
  named the post-handoff sequence claim, language, witness, one chain bundle,

  `proc-l-init` tuple, follow-up input, recipient before/after follow-up cells,
  routed signal-flow notes, and boundary text.
- Added `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_trace.py`, replaying the trace
  through `execute_post_handoff_signal_witness` and validating trace identity,
  participants, delivery, follow-up, sequence status, and boundaries.
- Focused green verification passed 8 post-handoff sequence trace tests.
  Adjacent post-handoff sequence/demo/evidence/language/claim tests passed 61
  tests. Live witness JSON still reported accepted status,

  not rejected by bundle validation, reports lacked `OK sequence-trace:`, and
  the demo omitted the trace layer.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/network_sequence_evidence_bundle.py` to load a
  `sequence_trace` artifact, include it in schema path validation, validate it
  through the existing network-sequence trace validator, and check trace
  agreement with bundle claim ID, helper, and expected status.

  failed because `autarkic_systems.vertical_demo` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/vertical_demo.py`, delegating acceptance to
  `build_project_status_report` and formatting the current post-handoff signal
  routing demonstration with evidence counts, claim/proof counts, proof-rule
  mix, blocked command frontier, canonical registries, and the checked
  sequence evidence bundle.
- Added `docs/vertical-demo-digest.md` and updated README, roadmap, and repo
  memory notes for the new first-run command.
- Focused vertical-demo tests passed 4 tests. Adjacent vertical-demo,
  project-status, and network-sequence demo tests passed 103 tests. Live text
  and JSON demo commands reported accepted status, 11 transition bundles,
  2 chain bundles, 1 sequence bundle, 52 `predicate-result` proof steps, and
  the remaining `standard-signal` frontier. `compileall`, `git diff --check`,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 906 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Handoff Demo Digest

- Added ADR-0215 to carry the vertical demo digest into the end-of-month
  handoff report.
- Added red handoff tests before implementation. The focused red run failed
  because `build_handoff_status` and `run_handoff_cli` did not accept an
  injectable vertical-demo builder, and handoff payload/text lacked vertical
  demo fields.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/handoff.py` so handoff readiness requires accepted
  project status, accepted vertical demo digest, and accepted GitHub
  submission. Handoff JSON now includes `vertical_demo_summary` and
  `vertical_demo`; handoff text now includes a `Vertical demo:` section.
- Updated README, roadmap, vertical-demo docs, and repo memory notes for the
  handoff composition change.
- Focused handoff tests passed 7 tests. Adjacent handoff, vertical-demo, and
  GitHub-submission tests passed 19 tests. Live text and JSON handoff runs
  with `--refresh-remotes` reported ready handoff state, accepted project
  status, accepted vertical demo, accepted remote refresh, and
  submitted-to-fork GitHub status. `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 907 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Vertical Demo Evidence Trail

- Added ADR-0216 to make the top-level vertical demo digest point to the
  concrete evidence artifacts behind the current checked demonstration.
- Added red vertical-demo tests before implementation. The focused red run
  failed because JSON/text output lacked `evidence_trail`,
  `missing_evidence_paths`, and `validation_subjects`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/vertical_demo.py` to reuse
  `build_network_sequence_demo_report`, require that demo report to be
  accepted, expose its evidence layers and validation subjects, and render an
  `Evidence trail:` section in text output.
- Updated handoff test fixtures so `python -m autarkic_systems.handoff`
  continues to carry the expanded vertical demo digest.
- Updated README, roadmap, vertical-demo docs, and repo memory notes for the
  new evidence-trail fields.
- Focused vertical-demo tests passed 4 tests. Adjacent handoff,
  vertical-demo, and network-sequence demo tests passed 25 tests. Live
  vertical-demo JSON and handoff text reported accepted status, no missing
  evidence paths, and the expanded evidence trail. `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full
  suite ran 907 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Vertical Demo Reproduction Commands

- Added ADR-0217 to make the vertical demo digest and handoff report name the
  exact commands that reproduce the current checked demonstration.

  red run failed because JSON/text output lacked `reproduction_commands` and a
  `Reproduce:` section.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/vertical_demo.py` with structured reproduction
  commands for the vertical demo, network-sequence demo JSON, project-status
  summary, and refreshed handoff. Text output now renders those commands under
  `Reproduce:`, and JSON/handoff output inherit the same list.
- Updated README, roadmap, vertical-demo docs, and repo memory notes for the
  reproduction-command surface.
- Focused vertical-demo tests passed 4 tests. Adjacent handoff,
  vertical-demo, and network-sequence demo tests passed 25 tests. Live

  run failed because JSON lacked `head.fork_commit_url` and text lacked
  `Fork commit: ...`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` with a derived
  `fork_commit_url`, JSON `head.fork_commit_url`, and text `Fork commit:`
  line. This does not contact GitHub APIs or change acceptance/refresh logic.
- Updated README, roadmap, and repo memory notes for the direct submitted
  commit link.
- Focused GitHub-submission and handoff tests passed 15 tests. Live
  GitHub-submission text/JSON and handoff commands reported accepted status

  failed because SCP-like `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` and
  `ssh://git@github.com/owner/repo.git` fork remotes produced non-web
  `fork_commit_url` values.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` with GitHub remote web URL
  normalization for HTTPS, SCP-like SSH, and `ssh://` remotes, while retaining
  the existing best-effort `.git` stripping fallback for unrecognized forms.
- Updated README, roadmap, and repo memory notes for the remote-normalized
  fork commit URL.

  handoff report include a fork-hosted compare URL from refreshed
  `origin/main` to submitted `HEAD`.
- Added red GitHub-submission and handoff tests before implementation. The red
  run failed because JSON lacked `fork_main.compare_url` and text lacked
  `Fork compare: ...`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` with a derived
  `fork_compare_url`, JSON `fork_main.compare_url`, and text `Fork compare:`
  line using the normalized fork remote web URL plus inspected origin/head
  commits.

- Added ADR-0223 to make the focused source-status frontier and aggregate
  project status expose `latest_source_review` as a first-class checked field.
- Added red source-status and project-status tests before implementation. The
  red run failed because the focused schema was still `2`, project status was
  still schema `20`, JSON lacked `latest_source_review`, text lacked
  `Latest source reviews:`, and a missing linked review path did not reject.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` to validate optional latest
  source-review metadata, read the linked review date, carry the compact review
  object in frontier JSON, render a `Latest source reviews:` section, and bump
  project status to schema version `21`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/source_status.py` to inherit that text section and
  bump the focused source-status schema to version `3`.
- Focused source-status and project-status tests passed 98 tests. Live
  source-status text/JSON rendered the dated standard-signal source review,
  live project-status summary/JSON reported accepted status and schema version
  `21`, and live handoff with refreshed remotes remained ready. `compileall`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 911 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Formal Confidence Target

- Added ADR-0224 to state the first machine-readable AS formal-confidence
  target while explicitly marking Willard-style self-consistency as blocked.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.formal_confidence`, the target manifest, and CLI surface
  did not exist.
- Added `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json`, documenting
  `AS-FORMAL-CONFIDENCE-TARGET-001` as blocked pending arithmetic object
  language, proof-code encoding, self-reference substitution,
  consistency-level selection, and deduction-apparatus selection.
- Added `autarkic_systems/formal_confidence.py` with text/JSON validation
  against the Willard definition map.
- Focused formal-confidence tests passed 11 tests. Live text and JSON CLI
  output reported one accepted blocked target with no failed subjects.

  the full suite ran 922 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Formal Confidence

- Added ADR-0225 to fold the checked formal-confidence target into aggregate
  project status and inherited handoff readiness.
- Added red project-status tests before implementation. The red run failed
  because project status remained schema version `21`, lacked
  `formal_confidence`, text/summary output omitted the formal-confidence line,
  CLI overrides were absent, and missing target manifests were not structured
  failures.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` to validate
  `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json` against the Willard map, include a
  `formal_confidence` JSON section with target status counts, require it for
  aggregate acceptance, render formal-confidence status/failures in text and
  summary modes, expose `--formal-confidence-targets` / `--willard-map`, and
  bump project status to schema version `22`.
- Focused project-status and handoff tests passed 94 tests. Live
  project-status text output rendered `Formal confidence: accepted (1 target;
  blocked=1)`, live summary and refreshed handoff inherited `Formal
  confidence: 1 target; blocked=1`, and live project-status JSON reported
  schema version `22`. `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 924 tests.

  `autarkic_systems.formal_arithmetic` and
  `language/formal_arithmetic_language.json` did not exist, and the
  formal-confidence target still listed `arithmetic-object-language` as a
  blocker.
- Added `language/formal_arithmetic_language.json`, a syntax-only Type-NS
  arithmetic surface naming terms, formulae, `delta0`, `pi1`, `sigma1`, and
  placeholder-only proof objects.
- Added `autarkic_systems/formal_arithmetic.py` with text/JSON validation
  against `sources/willard_definition_map.json`.
- Narrowed `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json` so
  `AS-FORMAL-CONFIDENCE-TARGET-001` points at the formal arithmetic language,
  records `delta0`, removes the arithmetic-object-language blocker, and
  remains blocked on proof-code encoding, self-reference substitution,
  consistency-level selection, and deduction-apparatus selection.
- Focused formal-arithmetic, formal-confidence, and project-status tests
  passed 109 tests. Live formal-arithmetic text/JSON output reported accepted
  Type-NS `delta0` syntax with no failed subjects; live formal-confidence
  output reported the remaining blockers without `arithmetic-object-language`;
  live project-status summary and refreshed handoff remained accepted.
  `compileall`, JSON checks, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest
  discover` passed; the full suite ran 935 tests.

  text/JSON validation, example round trips, duplicate-tag rejection,
  unknown-variable rejection, expected-code mismatch rejection, and trailing
  token rejection.
- Narrowed `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json` so
  `AS-FORMAL-CONFIDENCE-TARGET-001` points at the formal codebook, removes the
  proof-code-encoding blocker, and remains blocked on self-reference
  substitution, consistency-level selection, and deduction-apparatus selection.
- Focused formal-code, formal-confidence, and project-status tests passed 113
  tests. Live formal-code text/JSON output reported four accepted round-trip
  examples with no failed subjects; live formal-confidence output reported the

  self-reference-fixed-point, consistency-level selection, and
  deduction-apparatus selection.
- Focused formal-substitution, formal-confidence, and project-status tests
  passed 114 tests. Live formal-substitution text/JSON output reported four
  accepted examples with no failed subjects; live formal-confidence output

  self-reference-fixed-point and deduction-apparatus selection.
- Focused consistency-level, formal-confidence, and project-status tests passed
  109 tests. Live consistency-level text/JSON output reported the Level-1
  target with no failed subjects; live formal-confidence output reported the
  remaining blockers without `consistency-level-selection`; live project-status
  summary remained accepted. `compileall`, JSON checks, `git diff --check`,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 977 tests.

- Added ADR-0230 to remove the deduction-apparatus selection blocker from the
  formal-confidence target without claiming self-justification, proof search,
  or a theorem prover.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.deduction_apparatus` and
  `claims/deduction_apparatus_targets.json` did not exist, and the
  formal-confidence target still listed `deduction-apparatus-selection` as a
  blocker.
- Added `claims/deduction_apparatus_targets.json`, selecting the AS-local
  `predicate-result` proof-certificate checker as

  dependency validation, Willard generic/Hilbert/self-justifying/GenAC/tableau
  anchor checks, certificate-surface validation, combined proof-rule counts,
  and rejection of non-`predicate-result` rules, Hilbert/tableau overclaims,
  and self-justifying status values.
- Narrowed `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json` so
  `AS-FORMAL-CONFIDENCE-TARGET-001` points at the deduction-apparatus target,
  removes the deduction-apparatus-selection blocker, and remains blocked on
  self-reference-fixed-point.
- Focused deduction-apparatus, formal-confidence, and project-status tests
  passed 111 tests. Live deduction-apparatus text/JSON output reported 52
  `predicate-result` steps, 0 `manifest-example` steps, and no failed
  subjects; live formal-confidence output reported the remaining blocker
  without `deduction-apparatus-selection`; live project-status summary remained
  accepted. `compileall`, JSON checks, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 990 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Fixed-Point Target Surface

- Added ADR-0231 to narrow the self-reference blocker by selecting a checked
  fixed-point target template without claiming a diagonal lemma, quotation
  term, fixed-point equation proof, or self-consistency theorem.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point` and `claims/fixed_point_targets.json` did not
  exist, and the formal-confidence target still pointed at the broad
  `self-reference-fixed-point` blocker.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_targets.json`, selecting a `pi1` template with

  the formal codebook, substitution examples, consistency-level target, and
  deduction-apparatus target; Willard generic/Level(k)/SelfCons_k/GenAC anchor
  checks; template free-variable checks; expected instance/node/code checks;
  and rejection of statuses that claim a proved fixed point.
- Narrowed `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json` so
  `AS-FORMAL-CONFIDENCE-TARGET-001` points at the fixed-point target, replaces
  `self-reference-fixed-point` with `fixed-point-construction`, and remains
  blocked rather than claiming self-consistency.
- Focused fixed-point, formal-confidence, and project-status tests passed 110
  tests. Live fixed-point text/JSON output reported the `pi1` template and
  checked substitution instance with no failed subjects; live formal-confidence
  output reported the remaining blocker as `fixed-point-construction`; live
  project-status summary remained accepted. `compileall`, JSON checks,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite
  ran 1002 tests.

  `autarkic_systems.formal_quotation` and
  `language/formal_quotation_examples.json` did not exist, and the
  fixed-point target had no quotation dependency.
- Added `language/formal_quotation_examples.json`, with checked examples for
  `0` as `zero`, token `13` as a unary successor numeral, and the current
  fixed-point target instance code token sequence as token numerals only.
- Added `autarkic_systems/formal_quotation.py` with natural-to-numeral,
  numeral-to-natural, and token-sequence quotation helpers; formal-codebook
  dependency validation; Willard anchor checks; and rejection of negative
  tokens, expected-depth mismatches, and sequence-count mismatches.

  `AS-FIXED-POINT-SELFCONS1-TARGET` references the quotation examples and
  replaces broad quotation-term construction future work with
  sequence-level quotation construction.
- Focused formal-quotation, fixed-point, and project-status tests passed 112
  tests. Live formal-quotation text/JSON output reported three accepted
  examples with no failed subjects; live fixed-point output accepted the new
  quotation dependency; live project-status summary remained accepted.
  `compileall`, JSON checks, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 1015 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Quotation Sequence Surface

- Added ADR-0233 to wrap ADR-0232 token numerals in a checked
  `token-numeral-sequence` object without claiming arithmetic-language
  pair/list coding, a full quotation term, a diagonal lemma, or
  self-consistency.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.formal_quotation_sequence` and
  `language/formal_quotation_sequence_examples.json` did not exist, and the

  quotation, dependency validation against the token quotation examples,
  Willard anchor checks, text/JSON CLI output, and rejection of empty token
  sequences, endpoint-depth mismatches, and unknown sequence kinds/statuses.
- Narrowed `claims/fixed_point_targets.json` so
  `AS-FIXED-POINT-SELFCONS1-TARGET` references the quotation sequence
  examples and replaces the sequence-construction blocker with the remaining
  `quotation-term-construction` obligation.
- Updated the formal-confidence manifest and navigation docs to name the new
  quotation-sequence dependency while preserving the `fixed-point-construction`
  blocker.
- Focused formal-quotation-sequence, fixed-point, and project-status tests
  passed 111 tests. Live formal-quotation-sequence text/JSON output reported
  two accepted examples with no failed subjects; live fixed-point output
  accepted the quotation-sequence dependency; live formal-confidence JSON and
  project-status summary remained accepted and blocked. `compileall`, JSON
  checks, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed; the
  full suite ran 1027 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Quotation Term Surface

- Added ADR-0234 to turn the checked ADR-0233 token-numeral sequence into a
  formal term surface without claiming arithmetic sequence axioms,
  diagonalization, fixed-point equation proof, or self-consistency.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.formal_quotation_term` and
  `language/formal_quotation_term_examples.json` did not exist, the arithmetic
  language/codebook had no `sequence_nil` or `sequence_cons` constructors, and
  the fixed-point manifest had no `quotation_term_examples_path` field.
- Added `sequence_nil` and `sequence_cons` to
  `language/formal_arithmetic_language.json` and
  `language/formal_codebook.json`, plus encode/decode support in
  `autarkic_systems/formal_code.py` and a checked short sequence-term example.
- Added `language/formal_quotation_term_examples.json`, with checked examples
  for the current fixed-point target instance code and a short `[1, 0]`
  sequence.
- Added `autarkic_systems/formal_quotation_term.py` with nested
  `sequence_cons`/`sequence_nil` term construction, dependency validation
  against the formal codebook and quotation-sequence examples, Willard anchor
  checks, text/JSON CLI output, and rejection of empty token sequences,
  endpoint-depth mismatches, and unknown term kinds/statuses.
- Narrowed `claims/fixed_point_targets.json` so
  `AS-FIXED-POINT-SELFCONS1-TARGET` references the quotation-term examples and
  leaves `diagonal-lemma-proof`, `fixed-point-equation-proof`, and
  `self-consistency-theorem` as the remaining future work.
- Updated the formal-confidence manifest and navigation docs to name the new
  quotation-term dependency while preserving the `fixed-point-construction`
  blocker.
- Focused quotation-term, codebook, arithmetic-language, fixed-point, and
  project-status tests passed 139 tests. Live quotation-term text/JSON output
  reported two accepted examples with no failed subjects; live formal-code JSON
  reported five accepted examples and the new sequence term tags; live
  fixed-point output accepted the quotation-term dependency; live
  formal-confidence JSON and project-status summary remained accepted and
  blocked. `compileall`, JSON checks, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed; the full suite ran 1041 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Fixed-Point Equation Candidate

- Added ADR-0235 to construct and check the first naive fixed-point equation
  candidate without claiming diagonalization, a fixed-point equation proof, an
  arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_equation` and
  `claims/fixed_point_equation_candidates.json` did not exist.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_equation_candidates.json`, recording
  `AS-FIXED-POINT-SELFCONS1-NAIVE-QUOTE-CANDIDATE` as `candidate-not-fixed`,
  with expected original code `[41, 1, 22, 11, 1, 13, 12]`, observed candidate
  length `121`, and candidate prefix `[41, 1, 22, 11, 1, 17]`.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_equation.py` with dependency validation
  against the fixed-point target, quotation-term examples, formal codebook,
  and Willard anchors; construction of the naive quotation-term substitution;
  text/JSON CLI output; and rejection of unknown target IDs, unknown
  quotation-term examples, stale candidate lengths, and proved-equation
  statuses.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/formal_substitution.py` so `sequence_nil` and
  `sequence_cons` are recognized as term nodes for free-variable calculation
  and substitution. This was required for the checked quotation term to be a
  valid substitution replacement.
- Updated the formal-confidence manifest and navigation docs to name the
  fixed-point-equation candidate surface while preserving the
  `fixed-point-construction` blocker.
- Focused fixed-point-equation, formal-substitution, and project-status tests
  passed 117 tests. Live fixed-point-equation text/JSON output reported the
  candidate accepted as `candidate-not-fixed`, with `candidate_is_fixed=false`
  and observed length `121`; live formal-confidence JSON and project-status
  summary remained accepted and blocked. `compileall`, JSON checks,

- Added ADR-0236 to make the ADR-0235 fixed-point equation candidate a
  structured dependency of the aggregate formal-confidence target.

  validation against the fixed-point equation candidate and formal codebook,
  the quotation-term length formula, free-template-variable occurrence checks,
  text/JSON CLI output, and rejection of unknown candidate IDs, stale length
  facts, and overclaiming statuses.
- Focused fixed-point-obstruction and project-status tests passed 99 tests.

  and required configuration fields.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.formal_confidence` to load and validate the

## 2026-05-18 - Formal Complement Surface

- Added ADR-0239 to close the first code-level complement-relation gap needed
  by the Level-1 consistency target.

  text/JSON CLI output, codebook agreement checks, Willard anchor validation,
  and rejection of non-sentence nodes, stale expected codes, unknown sentence

- Updated `claims/consistency_level_targets.json` and
  `autarkic_systems.consistency_level` so Level-1 consistency selection
  validates the complement surface as a dependency.

  passed 111 tests. Live formal-complement text/JSON output reported two
  accepted examples; live consistency-level output reported `OK complement:

  codebook tags/examples, codebook encoder/decoder, and substitution traversal.
- Added `substitution_code(t,u)` to
  `language/formal_arithmetic_language.json` as a binary coding term without
  asserting arithmetic totality.

  `autarkic_systems.formal_substitution` to calculate free variables and
  substitute inside both term arguments.

  passed 46 tests. This preserves the fixed-point blocker: no substitution
  representability proof, diagonal lemma, fixed-point equation proof, or

  seed by replacing `n` with `substitution_code(n,n)`, quote the seed code,
  build the closed seed instance, and validate recorded code/free-variable
  facts.

  `AS-SUBSTITUTION-REPRESENTABILITY-DIAGONAL-SEED-WITNESS` as
  `representability-witness-not-proof`.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_representability.py` with helpers to
  rebuild the diagonal seed, use the seed code as both formula and argument
  code, quote the argument code as a term, and validate the closed output
  graph point.
- The checked formula and argument code are
  `[41, 1, 22, 11, 1, 18, 11, 4, 11, 4]`; the checked output is closed and
  has code length `296`.

  witness instance is closed and has code length `4815`.
- Focused substitution-graph formula tests passed 13 tests. This preserves the
  fixed-point blocker: no formula correctness proof, substitution
  representability proof, diagonal lemma, fixed-point equation proof, or
  self-consistency theorem is claimed.

## 2026-05-18 - Substitution Graph Witness Evaluator

- Added ADR-0250 to evaluate the concrete checked substitution graph formula
  witness without claiming formula correctness.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because the
  formula candidate did not expose witness-relation truth, evaluated output
  code length, evaluated output prefix, or stale-evaluation rejection.
- Added expected witness-evaluation facts to
  `claims/substitution_graph_formula_candidates.json`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_formula` to decode the quoted
  formula and argument codes in the closed witness instance, substitute the
  quoted argument into the decoded formula at the witness variable, encode the
  result, and compare it with the quoted output side.
- The checked witness relation evaluates true; the evaluated output code has
  length `296` and prefix `[41, 1, 22, 11, 1, 18, 17, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13]`.
- Focused substitution-graph formula tests passed 15 tests. This preserves the

  formal arithmetic language, formal codebook, graph target, formula
  candidate, finite evaluation examples, explicit future work, and non-claims.

## 2026-05-18 - Formal Confidence Substitution Graph Correctness Dependency

- Added ADR-0253 to make the ADR-0252 substitution graph correctness target a
  structured dependency of aggregate formal-confidence validation.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `REQUIRED_CONFIGURATION_FIELDS` had no `substitution_graph_correctness`
  field, the checked manifest had no corresponding path, and missing
  correctness targets did not reject formal-confidence validation.
- Added `substitution_graph_correctness` to
  `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json`, pointing at
  `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_targets.json`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/formal_confidence.py` to load and validate the
  substitution graph correctness target, reporting
  `substitution graph correctness target accepted` on the healthy path and
  `target-substitution-graph-correctness` on failure.
- Focused formal-confidence/project-status tests passed 106 tests. The
  formal-confidence target remains blocked on fixed-point construction.

## 2026-05-18 - Substitution Graph Correctness Cases

- Added ADR-0254 to decompose the substitution graph correctness target into
  explicit open proof cases.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_correctness_cases` and
  `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` did not exist.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` with five cases:
  codebook round-trip, quotation-term closure, meta-substitution semantics,
  formula-schema relation, and diagonal-witness composition.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.py`, validating
  the correctness target, formal codebook, quotation-term examples,
  formal-substitution examples, formula candidate, substitution witness,
  dependency lists, future work, and non-claims.
- Focused substitution-graph correctness-case tests passed 12 tests. This
  creates a proof-case map without proving formula correctness.

## 2026-05-18 - Formal Confidence Correctness Cases Dependency

- Added ADR-0255 to make the ADR-0254 substitution graph correctness case map
  a structured dependency of aggregate formal-confidence validation.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `REQUIRED_CONFIGURATION_FIELDS` had no `substitution_graph_correctness_cases`
  field, healthy reports had no accepted correctness-cases result, and missing
  correctness-case manifests did not reject formal-confidence validation.
- Added `substitution_graph_correctness_cases` to
  `claims/formal_confidence_targets.json`, pointing at
  `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json`.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/formal_confidence.py` to load and validate the
  substitution graph correctness case map, reporting
  `substitution graph correctness cases accepted` on the healthy path and

- Focused formal-confidence/project-status tests passed 107 tests. The
  formal-confidence target remains blocked on fixed-point construction.

## 2026-05-18 - Origin Main Submission Status

- Added ADR-0256 to make GitHub submission and handoff reports prefer source
  `origin/main` evidence now that the current account has WRITE access to
  `jpt4/as`.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because a matching
  `origin/main` was still labeled `submitted-to-fork`, and a source-submitted
  state with stale `fork/main` did not count as accepted handoff evidence.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.github_submission` so `origin/main` matching
  `HEAD` reports `submitted-to-origin`, renders `origin/main: matches HEAD`,
  and remains accepted even when the fork ref is stale.
- Preserved the existing `submitted-to-fork` fallback when `origin/main` does
  not match but `fork/main` does.
- Focused GitHub submission and handoff tests passed 21 tests.

## 2026-05-19 - Substitution Graph Codebook Roundtrip Domain

- Added ADR-0257 to make the first substitution graph correctness case depend
  on finite codebook roundtrip evidence over the current graph-domain codes.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip` and
  `claims/substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip.json` did not exist, the
  correctness-case manifest had no `codebook_roundtrip_path`, and the first
  case still depended only on `correctness_target` and `codebook`.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip.json` with an expected
  12-subject finite domain derived from the formula candidate and finite
  evaluation examples.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip.py`, deriving
  those code subjects, decoding each through the formal codebook, and
  re-encoding each to the same token sequence.
- Updated `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.py` so the
  `codebook-roundtrip` case requires the accepted `codebook_roundtrip`
  dependency.
- Focused roundtrip/correctness-case tests passed 22 tests. This is finite
  evidence for the first open correctness case, not a general formula
  correctness or substitution representability proof.

## 2026-05-19 - Substitution Graph Quotation Term Closure Domain

- Added ADR-0258 to make the second substitution graph correctness case depend
  on finite quotation-term closure evidence over the current graph-domain
  codes.

  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure` and
  `claims/substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure.json` did not exist, the
  correctness-case manifest had no `quotation_term_closure_path`, and the
  second case still depended only on `correctness_target`, `codebook`, and
  `quotation_term`.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure.json` with an
  expected 12-subject finite domain reused from the formula candidate and
  finite evaluation examples.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure.py`,
  deriving those code subjects, quoting each as a nested sequence term,
  checking closure, recovering the original tokens, and round-tripping each
  term through the formal codebook.
- Updated `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip.py` so the
  graph-domain subject derivation can be reused without duplicating the
  witness/evaluation logic.
- Updated `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.py` so the
  `quotation-term-closure` case requires the accepted
  `quotation_term_closure` dependency.
- Focused quotation-closure/correctness-case tests passed 22 tests, and the
  ADR-0257 roundtrip regression passed 10 tests. This is finite evidence for
  the second open correctness case, not a general quotation closure or formula
  correctness proof.

## 2026-05-19 - Substitution Graph Meta-Substitution Semantics Domain

- Added ADR-0259 to make the third substitution graph correctness case depend
  on finite meta-substitution semantic evidence over the current graph-domain
  substitutions.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics` and
  `claims/substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics.json` did not exist,
  the correctness-case manifest had no `meta_substitution_semantics_path`, and
  the third case still depended only on `correctness_target` and
  `formal_substitution`.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics.json` with an
  expected 6-subject finite domain: three formula-candidate graph-variable
  substitutions and three finite-evaluation substitutions.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics.py`,
  deriving those substitutions, checking closed replacement quotation terms,
  checking the closed-replacement free-variable rule, checking no-op behavior
  when the substituted variable is not free, and checking agreement with the
  existing expected formula/evaluation surfaces.
- Updated `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.py` so the
  `meta-substitution-semantics` case requires the accepted
  `meta_substitution_semantics` dependency.
- Focused meta-substitution/correctness-case tests passed 22 tests. This is
  finite evidence for the third open correctness case, not a general
  substitution or formula correctness proof.

## 2026-05-19 - Substitution Graph Formula Schema Relation Domain

- Added ADR-0260 to make the fourth substitution graph correctness case depend
  on finite relation evidence that the current graph target, formula schema,
  witness instance, and finite examples state the same substitution-code graph
  relation.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation` and
  `claims/substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation.json` did not exist, the
  correctness-case manifest had no `formula_schema_relation_path`, and the
  fourth case still depended only on `correctness_target` and
  `formula_candidate`.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation.json` with an
  expected 4-point finite domain: one witness relation point and three
  finite-evaluation relation points.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation.py`,
  deriving those relation points, checking schema instance closure, checking
  formula-code roundtrip, evaluating the instantiated schema relation, and
  checking agreement with the existing witness/example surfaces.
- Updated `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.py` so the
  `formula-schema-relation` case requires the accepted
  `formula_schema_relation` dependency.
- Focused formula-schema-relation/correctness-case tests passed 22 tests, the
  adjacent graph/formula/evaluation/correctness target regression passed 61
  tests, and the full default suite passed 1,222 tests. This is finite
  evidence for the fourth open correctness case, not a general formula
  correctness or substitution representability proof.

## 2026-05-19 - Substitution Graph Diagonal Witness Composition Domain

- Added ADR-0261 to make the fifth substitution graph correctness case depend
  on finite composition evidence tying the correctness target, formula-schema
  relation witness, substitution witness, diagonal seed, and fixed-point target
  to the same self-application route.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition` and
  `claims/substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition.json` did not exist,
  the correctness-case manifest had no `diagonal_witness_composition_path`, and
  the fifth case still depended only on `correctness_target` and
  `substitution_representability`.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition.json` with an
  expected 1-point finite domain for the current diagonal witness.
- Added `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition.py`,
  checking target/candidate/witness/construction/fixed-point alignment,
  self-application inputs, identical witness-output and diagonal-instance
  codes, output surfaces, and the accepted formula-schema relation witness
  point.
- Updated `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_cases.py` so the
  `diagonal-witness-composition` case requires the accepted
  `diagonal_witness_composition` dependency.
- Focused diagonal-witness-composition/correctness-case tests passed 22 tests.
  Adjacent substitution graph, representability, diagonal-construction, and
  fixed-point regression tests passed 69 tests, and the full default suite
  passed 1,232 tests. This is finite evidence for the fifth open correctness
  case, not a general diagonal lemma, substitution representability proof, or
  fixed-point equation proof.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Equation Bridge Target

- Added ADR-0262 to make the remaining fixed-point-construction blocker more
  exact: the diagonal instance and direct fixed-point target form are now
  connected by a checked finite bridge target.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_equation_bridge` and
  `claims/fixed_point_equation_bridge_targets.json` did not exist, aggregate
  formal-confidence validation had no `fixed_point_equation_bridge`
  configuration field, and missing bridge targets did not reject.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_equation_bridge_targets.json`, naming
  `AS-FIXED-POINT-SELFCONS1-DIAGONAL-EQUATION-BRIDGE` as an open bridge target.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_equation_bridge.py`, checking the
  296-token diagonal instance, the 4528-token direct target form, the
  4815-token bridge equality, shared target skeleton, diagonal and direct
  slots, and the substitution-witness output match.
- Updated aggregate formal-confidence validation to require and fail closed
  over the new bridge target while preserving the
  `fixed-point-construction` blocker.
- Focused fixed-point-equation-bridge/formal-confidence tests passed 32 tests.
  Adjacent fixed-point, substitution-representability, diagonal-witness
  composition, and formal-confidence tests passed 92 tests, and the full
  default suite passed 1,244 tests. This names the equality still needed for
  the fixed-point equation; it is not a substitution representability proof,
  substitution graph correctness proof, fixed-point equation proof, or
  self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Construction Cases

- Added ADR-0263 to decompose the remaining fixed-point construction blocker
  into five open proof cases: diagonal-instance closure, substitution
  representability proof, substitution graph correctness proof, bridge equality
  proof, and fixed-point equation lifting.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_construction_cases` and
  `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` did not exist, aggregate
  formal-confidence validation had no `fixed_point_construction_cases`
  configuration field, missing construction-case manifests did not reject, and
  the text report did not expose construction-case acceptance.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json`, naming all five proof
  cases as `proof-case-open` and preserving explicit non-claims for
  substitution representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge
  equality, fixed-point equations, arithmetized proof predicates, and
  self-consistency.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py`, checking the
  case set, dependency subjects, future work, non-claims, dependency
  acceptance, stale dependencies, and overclaiming statuses.
- Updated aggregate formal-confidence validation to require and fail closed
  over the construction-case map while preserving the
  `fixed-point-construction` blocker.
- Focused construction/formal-confidence tests passed 33 tests. Live
  construction-case text/JSON output reported five open cases with no failed
  subjects; live formal-confidence output reported the construction-case map
  accepted while keeping one blocked target; live project-status summary
  remained accepted. Adjacent fixed-point and substitution-graph regression
  tests passed 106 tests, compileall/JSON/diff checks passed, and the full
  default suite passed 1,256 tests. This is not a substitution
  representability proof, substitution graph correctness proof, bridge equality
  proof, fixed-point equation proof, or self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Diagonal Instance Closure Domain

- Added ADR-0264 to make the first fixed-point construction case depend on
  finite evidence that the current diagonal instance is closed,
  codebook-stable, target-skeleton aligned, and bridge-aligned.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure` and
  `claims/fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure.json` did not exist, the
  construction-case manifest had no `diagonal_instance_closure_path`, and the
  first construction case still had only three dependency subjects.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure.json` with a one-point
  finite closure domain for the current diagonal instance.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure.py`, deriving
  the current diagonal instance and checking closure, codebook roundtrip,
  target skeleton preservation, diagonal slot shape, and bridge agreement.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py` so the
  `diagonal-instance-closure` case requires the accepted
  `diagonal_instance_closure` dependency while remaining `proof-case-open`.
- Focused diagonal-instance-closure/construction-cases tests passed 22 tests.
  Live diagonal-instance-closure text/JSON output reported one closed,
  codebook-stable, bridge-aligned closure point with no failed subjects; live
  construction-cases JSON reported `diagonal_instance_closure` as accepted for
  the first case; live formal-confidence JSON remained accepted with one
  blocked target; live project-status summary remained accepted. Adjacent
  fixed-point construction regression tests passed 80 tests, compileall/JSON
  parsing/diff checks passed, and the full default suite passed 1,267 tests.
  This is not a substitution representability proof, substitution graph
  correctness proof, bridge equality proof, fixed-point equation proof,
  arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Substitution Witness Bridge Domain

- Added ADR-0265 to make the second fixed-point construction case depend on
  finite evidence tying the current substitution witness, graph correctness
  cases, fixed-point equation bridge, and diagonal-instance closure to the same
  self-application route.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_substitution_witness_bridge` and
  `claims/fixed_point_substitution_witness_bridge.json` did not exist, the
  construction-case manifest had no `substitution_witness_bridge_path`, and the
  second construction case still had only three dependency subjects.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_substitution_witness_bridge.json` with a one-point
  finite witness-bridge domain for the current substitution witness.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_substitution_witness_bridge.py`, deriving
  the current witness bridge and checking route ID agreement,
  self-application inputs, seed-code agreement, witness-output/diagonal-instance
  agreement, bridge-observation agreement, closure-observation agreement, and
  accepted substitution graph correctness cases.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py` so the
  `substitution-representability-proof` case requires the accepted
  `substitution_witness_bridge` dependency while remaining `proof-case-open`.
- Focused substitution-witness-bridge/construction-cases tests passed 22 tests.
  Live substitution-witness-bridge text/JSON output reported one aligned
  witness bridge with no failed subjects; live construction-cases JSON reported
  `substitution_witness_bridge` as accepted for the second case; live
  formal-confidence JSON remained accepted with one blocked target; live
  project-status summary remained accepted. Adjacent fixed-point construction
  regression tests passed 103 tests, compileall/JSON parsing/diff checks
  passed, and the full default suite passed 1,278 tests. This is not a
  substitution representability proof, substitution graph correctness proof,
  bridge equality proof, fixed-point equation proof, arithmetized proof
  predicate, or self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Substitution Graph Correctness Bridge Domain

- Added ADR-0266 to make the third fixed-point construction case depend on
  finite dependency-coverage evidence tying the construction case to the
  checked substitution graph correctness target, correctness case map, and all
  five finite graph-domain dependency surfaces.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_substitution_graph_correctness_bridge` and
  `claims/fixed_point_substitution_graph_correctness_bridge.json` did not
  exist, the construction-case manifest had no
  `substitution_graph_correctness_bridge_path`, and the third construction
  case still had only two dependency subjects.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_substitution_graph_correctness_bridge.json` with a
  one-point finite graph-correctness bridge domain for the current fixed-point
  construction case.
- Added
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_substitution_graph_correctness_bridge.py`,
  checking that the construction case remains open, requires the bridge,
  observes all five graph correctness cases, keeps all five finite dependency
  surfaces accepted, and links the current diagonal-witness composition to the
  fixed-point target and graph correctness target.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py` so the
  `substitution-graph-correctness-proof` case requires the accepted
  `substitution_graph_correctness_bridge` dependency while remaining
  `proof-case-open`.
- Focused graph-correctness-bridge/construction-cases tests passed 22 tests.
  Live graph-correctness-bridge text/JSON output reported one bridge, five
  correctness cases, five accepted finite dependencies, linked diagonal
  composition, and no failed subjects; live construction-cases JSON reported
  `substitution_graph_correctness_bridge` as accepted for the third case; live
  formal-confidence JSON remained accepted with one blocked target; live
  project-status summary remained accepted. Adjacent fixed-point
  graph-correctness regression tests passed 106 tests, compileall/JSON
  parsing/diff checks passed, and the full default suite passed 1,289 tests.
  This is not a substitution graph correctness proof, bridge equality proof,
  fixed-point equation proof, arithmetized proof predicate, or
  self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Bridge Equality Alignment Domain

- Added ADR-0267 to make the fourth fixed-point construction case depend on
  finite alignment evidence tying the construction case to the checked
  fixed-point equation bridge, substitution-witness bridge, graph correctness
  bridge, and formula-schema witness relation.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment` and
  `claims/fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment.json` did not exist, the
  construction-case manifest had no `bridge_equality_alignment_path`, and the
  fourth construction case still had only three dependency subjects.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment.json` with a one-point
  finite bridge-equality alignment domain for the current fixed-point
  construction case.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment.py`, checking
  that the construction case remains open, requires the alignment, observes
  the accepted bridge/witness/graph/schema dependency surfaces, matches the
  4815-token bridge equation length to the schema witness instance, and keeps
  target/witness route identifiers aligned.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py` so the
  `bridge-equality-proof` case requires the accepted
  `bridge_equality_alignment` dependency while remaining `proof-case-open`.
- Focused bridge-equality-alignment/construction-cases tests passed 22 tests.
  Live bridge-equality-alignment text/JSON output reported one alignment, a
  4815-token bridge equation, schema-instance alignment, route alignment, and
  no failed subjects; live construction-cases JSON reported
  `bridge_equality_alignment` as accepted for the fourth case; live
  formal-confidence JSON remained accepted with one blocked target; live
  project-status summary remained accepted. Adjacent fixed-point bridge
  regression tests passed 98 tests, compileall/JSON parsing/diff checks
  passed, and the full default suite passed 1,300 tests. This is not a bridge
  equality proof, fixed-point equation proof, arithmetized proof predicate, or
  self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Equation Lifting Alignment Domain

- Added ADR-0268 to make the fifth fixed-point construction case depend on
  finite alignment evidence tying the selected `pi1` fixed-point target
  context, checked equation bridge, bridge-equality alignment, and codebook to
  the same direct target form.
- Added red tests before implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_equation_lifting_alignment` and
  `claims/fixed_point_equation_lifting_alignment.json` did not exist, the
  construction-case manifest had no `equation_lifting_alignment_path`, and the
  fifth construction case still had only three dependency subjects.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_equation_lifting_alignment.json` with a one-point
  finite equation-lifting alignment domain for the current fixed-point
  construction case.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_equation_lifting_alignment.py`, checking
  that the construction case remains open, requires the alignment, observes
  accepted fixed-point target/equation bridge/bridge-equality/codebook
  dependency surfaces, keeps the selected target as a `pi1` template over free
  code variable `n`, keeps the 4528-token direct target context matched, and
  keeps bridge-equality route alignment visible.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py` so the
  `fixed-point-equation-lifting` case requires the accepted
  `equation_lifting_alignment` dependency while remaining `proof-case-open`.
- Focused equation-lifting-alignment/construction-cases tests passed 22 tests.
  Live equation-lifting-alignment text/JSON output reported one alignment, a
  4528-token direct target, target/context alignment, route alignment, and no
  failed subjects; live construction-cases text/JSON output reported
  `equation_lifting_alignment` as accepted for the fifth case; live
  formal-confidence text/JSON remained accepted with one blocked target; live
  project-status summary remained accepted. Adjacent fixed-point regression
  tests passed 111 tests, compileall/JSON parsing/diff checks passed, and the
  full default suite passed 1,311 tests. This is not a bridge equality proof,
  fixed-point equation proof, arithmetized proof predicate, or
  self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-19 - Fixed-Point Bridge Equality Evaluation Domain

- Added ADR-0269 to make the fourth fixed-point construction case depend on
  finite evaluation evidence for the checked left bridge term,
  `substitution_code(quote(seed), quote(seed))`.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_bridge_equality_evaluation.json` with a one-point
  finite bridge-equality evaluation domain for the current fixed-point
  construction case.
- Added `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_bridge_equality_evaluation.py`,
  deriving the evaluation from the construction-case map, fixed-point target,
  equation bridge, substitution representability surface, bridge-equality
  alignment, and codebook. The validator checks that the left bridge term
  decodes and evaluates to the 296-token diagonal instance code, matches the
  substitution witness output, matches the right quoted bridge term, and keeps
  the 4815-token bridge equation surface stable.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_cases.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_cases.py` so the
  `bridge-equality-proof` case requires the accepted
  `bridge_equality_evaluation` dependency while remaining `proof-case-open`.
- Updated README, roadmap, AFS requirements, fixed-point construction docs,
  bridge-equality alignment docs, formal-confidence docs, and project memory
  so the new finite evaluation dependency is visible without overclaiming it.
  This is not a bridge equality proof, fixed-point equation proof,
  arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency theorem.

## 2026-05-20 - Test Suite Selection Manifest

- Added ADR-0272 to separate the default fast unittest path from explicit
  extended fixed-point/status regressions without changing validators,
  manifests, mathematical semantics, or existing skip decorators.
- Wrote `tests/test_suite_selection.py` before implementation. The red run of
  `python -m unittest tests.test_suite_selection` failed because
  `autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection` did not exist.
- Added `tests/suite_manifest.json` with schema/version/id, two leaf suites
  (`fast` and `extended-fixed-point`), the aggregate `all` suite, rationale,
  and non-goals. A live first fast run with only the initial expected extended
  candidates passed but took 927.401 seconds and still spent substantial time
  in other fixed-point modules, so the extended suite was tightened to all
  current `tests.test_fixed_point_*` modules plus formal-confidence,
  project-status, handoff, and vertical-demo aggregate checks. The boundary
  intentionally leaves substitution-graph finite-domain tests on the fast path.
- Added `autarkic_systems/test_suite_selection.py`, a stdlib-only selector
  that discovers `tests/test_*.py`, validates that every discovered module is
  classified exactly once into one leaf suite, fails closed over stale explicit
  module names, lists suites without running tests, and runs selected modules
  through `unittest` when not listing.

## 2026-05-20 - Fixed-Point Construction Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0273 to provide a compact fixed-point construction frontier status
  over the post-ADR-0270 stack without running the deep construction-case
  validators from the status layer.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_construction_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_frontier_status.py`, checking the
  expected frontier manifest shape, seven support-surface paths, five
  `proof-case-open` construction cases, per-case finite-support mappings, the
  `blocked` frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added `tests/test_fixed_point_construction_frontier_status.py` before the
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_construction_frontier_status` did not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 12 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `fixed-point-construction` as the
  blocker, five of five construction cases open, seven support surfaces, and
  no failed subjects. Compileall, JSON parsing, and diff whitespace checks
  passed.
- Updated the ADR-0272 suite manifest so the new
  `tests.test_fixed_point_construction_frontier_status` module is classified
  into `extended-fixed-point`; the selector's fail-closed invariant caught that
  this new fixed-point test cannot remain implicit.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove substitution
  representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge equality, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Fixed-Point Equation Lifting Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0278 to provide a compact fixed-point equation lifting frontier
  status over the construction case with kind `fixed-point-equation-lifting`.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_equation_lifting_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_equation_lifting_frontier_status.py`, checking
  the expected frontier manifest shape, construction-case openness, exact
  dependency/support subjects, fixed-point target support, equation bridge
  support, codebook support, equation-lifting alignment support, the
  `blocked` frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added `tests/test_fixed_point_equation_lifting_frontier_status.py` before
  the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_equation_lifting_frontier_status` did not
  exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 14 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `fixed-point-equation-lifting` as the
  blocker, the construction case still `proof-case-open`, four support
  surfaces, direct target length 4528, bridge equation length 4815, and no
  failed subjects.
- Updated the ADR-0272 suite manifest so the new
  `tests.test_fixed_point_equation_lifting_frontier_status` module is
  classified into `extended-fixed-point`.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove substitution
  representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge equality, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Quotation Term Closure Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0280 to provide a compact substitution graph
  quotation-term-closure frontier status over the existing correctness proof
  case and finite support surface.
- Added
  `claims/substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the matching
  `quotation-term-closure` correctness case, required support paths, the
  existing quotation-term-closure support validator, the `blocked` frontier
  status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure_frontier_status.py`
  before the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_quotation_term_closure_frontier_status`
  did not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 14 tests. The focused suite plus
  `tests.test_suite_selection` passed 19 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `quotation-term-closure` as the
  blocker, the correctness case still `proof-case-open`, one accepted support
  surface, twelve closure subjects, and no failed subjects. Compileall, JSON
  parsing, and diff whitespace checks passed.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Formula Schema Relation Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0282 to provide a compact substitution graph
  formula-schema-relation frontier status over the existing substitution graph
  correctness proof case with kind `formula-schema-relation`.
- Added
  `claims/substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the existing correctness-case
  map, the matching `proof-case-open` case, required support paths, accepted
  formula-schema-relation support, four finite relation points, the `blocked`
  frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation_frontier_status.py`
  before the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_formula_schema_relation_frontier_status`
  did not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 14 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `formula-schema-relation` as the
  blocker, the correctness case still `proof-case-open`, one support surface,
  four relation points, and no failed subjects.
- A suite-selector check kept this non-fixed-point status test on the fast
  discovered path; `tests/suite_manifest.json` did not need an edit.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Correctness Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0274 to provide a compact substitution graph correctness frontier
  status over the existing correctness proof-case stack without running the
  deep support derivations from the status layer.
- Added `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the existing correctness-case
  manifest, eleven referenced support surfaces, five `proof-case-open`
  correctness cases, per-case support mappings, the `blocked` frontier status,
  and explicit non-claims.
- Added `tests/test_substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status.py` before
  the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status` did not
  exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 13 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `substitution-graph-correctness` as
  the blocker, five of five correctness cases open, eleven support surfaces,
  and no failed subjects. Compileall, JSON parsing, and diff whitespace checks
  passed.
- A suite-selector list check confirmed the new substitution-graph status test
  remains covered by the fast discovered suite boundary, so
  `tests/suite_manifest.json` did not need an edit.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Fixed-Point Substitution Representability Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0275 to provide a compact fixed-point substitution
  representability frontier status over the construction case with kind
  `substitution-representability-proof`.
- Added
  `claims/fixed_point_substitution_representability_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_substitution_representability_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the current construction-case
  map, substitution representability target, substitution graph correctness
  cases, fixed-point equation bridge, substitution witness bridge, the
  `blocked` frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_fixed_point_substitution_representability_frontier_status.py`
  before the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_substitution_representability_frontier_status`
  did not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 12 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting
  `substitution-representability-proof` as the blocker, the construction case
  still `proof-case-open`, five support surfaces, one witness bridge, witness
  output length 296, and no failed subjects.
- Updated the ADR-0272 suite manifest so the new
  `tests.test_fixed_point_substitution_representability_frontier_status`
  module is classified into `extended-fixed-point`.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove substitution
  representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge equality, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Fixed-Point Bridge Equality Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0276 to provide a compact fixed-point bridge equality frontier
  status over the construction case with kind `bridge-equality-proof`.
- Added `claims/fixed_point_bridge_equality_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_bridge_equality_frontier_status.py`, checking
  the expected frontier manifest shape, construction-case openness, fixed-point
  equation bridge support, substitution representability support,
  substitution graph correctness case support, bridge equality alignment,
  bridge equality evaluation, the `blocked` frontier status, and explicit
  non-claims.
- Added `tests/test_fixed_point_bridge_equality_frontier_status.py` before the
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_bridge_equality_frontier_status` did not
  exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 13 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `bridge-equality-proof` as the
  blocker, the construction case still `proof-case-open`, five support
  surfaces, bridge equation length 4815, evaluation output length 296, and no
  failed subjects.
- Updated the ADR-0272 suite manifest so the new
  `tests.test_fixed_point_bridge_equality_frontier_status` module is
  classified into `extended-fixed-point`.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove substitution
  representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge equality, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Fixed-Point Diagonal Instance Closure Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0277 to provide a compact fixed-point diagonal-instance-closure
  frontier status over the construction case with kind
  `diagonal-instance-closure`.
- Added
  `claims/fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, construction-case openness,
  fixed-point target support, diagonal construction support, fixed-point
  equation bridge support, diagonal-instance closure support, diagonal
  candidate support, the `blocked` frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure_frontier_status.py`
  before the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure_frontier_status`
  did not exist.
- The focused frontier-status suite passed 14 tests. Live text and JSON CLI
  checks accepted the status surface, reporting
  `diagonal-instance-closure` as the blocker, the construction case still
  `proof-case-open`, five support surfaces, diagonal-instance length 296, one
  diagonal candidate, and no failed subjects.
- Updated the ADR-0272 suite manifest so the new
  `tests.test_fixed_point_diagonal_instance_closure_frontier_status` module is
  classified into `extended-fixed-point`.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove substitution
  representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge equality, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Codebook Roundtrip Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0279 to provide a compact substitution graph codebook-roundtrip
  frontier status over the existing substitution graph correctness proof case
  with kind `codebook-roundtrip`.
- Added
  `claims/substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip_frontier_status.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the existing correctness-case
  map, the matching `proof-case-open` case, required support paths, accepted
  codebook-roundtrip support, 12 finite roundtrip subjects, the `blocked`
  frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip_frontier_status.py` before
  the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_codebook_roundtrip_frontier_status` did
  not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 14 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `codebook-roundtrip` as the blocker,
  the correctness case still `proof-case-open`, two support surfaces, 12
  roundtrip subjects, and no failed subjects.
- A suite-selector check kept this non-fixed-point status test on the fast
  discovered path; `tests/suite_manifest.json` did not need an edit.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Meta-Substitution Semantics Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0281 to provide a compact substitution graph
  meta-substitution-semantics frontier status over the existing correctness
  proof case and finite support surface.
- Added
  `claims/substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics_frontier_status.json`
  and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the matching
  `meta-substitution-semantics` correctness case, required support paths, the
  existing meta-substitution-semantics support validator, the `blocked`
  frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics_frontier_status.py`
  before the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_meta_substitution_semantics_frontier_status`
  did not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 15 tests. The focused suite plus
  `tests.test_suite_selection` passed 20 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `meta-substitution-semantics` as the
  blocker, the correctness case still `proof-case-open`, one accepted support
  surface, six semantic subjects, and no failed subjects. Compileall, JSON
  parsing, and diff whitespace checks passed.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Diagonal Witness Composition Frontier Status

- Added ADR-0283 to provide a compact substitution graph
  diagonal-witness-composition frontier status over the existing substitution
  graph correctness proof case with kind `diagonal-witness-composition`.
- Added
  `claims/substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition_frontier_status.json`
  and
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition_frontier_status.py`,
  checking the expected frontier manifest shape, the existing correctness-case
  map, the matching `proof-case-open` case, required support paths, accepted
  diagonal-witness-composition support, one finite composition subject, the
  `blocked` frontier status, and explicit non-claims.
- Added
  `tests/test_substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition_frontier_status.py`
  before the implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_diagonal_witness_composition_frontier_status`
  did not exist.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 15 tests. Live text and JSON CLI checks
  accepted the status surface, reporting `diagonal-witness-composition` as the
  blocker, the correctness case still `proof-case-open`, two support surfaces,
  one composition subject, and no failed subjects.
- A suite-selector check kept this non-fixed-point status test on the fast
  discovered path; `tests/suite_manifest.json` did not need an edit.
- This is a compact frontier handoff only. It does not prove formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Substitution Graph Correctness Case Status Rollup

- Added ADR-0284 to roll the five compact substitution graph correctness
  per-case frontier status surfaces into the existing aggregate correctness
  frontier status.
- Updated `claims/substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status.json` with
  `case_status_paths` for `codebook-roundtrip`, `quotation-term-closure`,
  `meta-substitution-semantics`, `formula-schema-relation`, and
  `diagonal-witness-composition`.
- Updated
  `autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status.py` so the
  aggregate validator imports and runs the existing compact per-case status
  validators, then exposes a `case_status_rollup` with accepted status,
  blocker, proof-case status, path, and failed subjects.
- Extended
  `tests/test_substitution_graph_correctness_frontier_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because the aggregate manifest/report did
  not yet expose `case_status_paths`, `case_status_count`, or the text rollup.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 17 tests. The focused suite plus
  `tests.test_suite_selection` passed 22 tests. Live JSON checks accepted the
  aggregate status with five accepted compact case statuses and no failed
  subjects.
- This remains a handoff/status surface only. It does not promote formula
  correctness, substitution representability, the diagonal lemma, a
  fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or self-consistency.

## 2026-05-20 - Fixed-Point Construction Case Status Rollup

- Added ADR-0285 to roll the five compact fixed-point construction case-status
  handoffs into the existing aggregate fixed-point construction frontier
  status.
- Updated `claims/fixed_point_construction_frontier_status.json` with
  `case_status_paths` for `diagonal-instance-closure`,
  `substitution-representability-proof`,
  `substitution-graph-correctness-proof`, `bridge-equality-proof`, and
  `fixed-point-equation-lifting`.
- Updated
  `autarkic_systems/fixed_point_construction_frontier_status.py` so the
  aggregate validator imports and runs the existing compact status validators,
  then exposes a `case_status_rollup` with accepted status, frontier status,
  expected blocker, observed blocker, construction-case status, path, and
  failed subjects.
- The rollup uses an explicit expected-blocker map because the fixed-point
  construction case kind `substitution-graph-correctness-proof` is owned by
  the compact status blocked by `substitution-graph-correctness`.
- Extended `tests/test_fixed_point_construction_frontier_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because the aggregate manifest/report did
  not yet expose `case_status_paths`, `case_status_count`, or the text rollup.
- Focused frontier-status tests passed 16 tests. Live JSON checks accepted the
  aggregate status with five accepted compact construction-case statuses and
  no failed subjects.
- This remains a handoff/status surface only. It does not promote
  substitution representability, substitution graph correctness, bridge
  equality, a fixed-point equation, an arithmetized proof predicate, or
  self-consistency.
