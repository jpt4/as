# Development Log

## 2026-05-16 - Initial Orientation Scaffold

- Cloned `https://github.com/jpt4/as` at commit
  `1a2fc06b75f5d33aee6655956c2a56df07a7bfb0`. The repository initially
  contained only `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md~`.
- Reviewed the project prelude in `AGENTS.md`: Autarkic Systems is an
  open-ended cross-disciplinary investigation that subsumes AFS, PRC, and
  SJAS, with a lower-bound objective of theory plus machinic implementation of
  an artificial entity demonstrating cognitive sovereignty.
- Fetched the three referenced subordinate repositories for review:
  - `jpt4/afs` at `a61592eab02a93d480149ce3465af5e3271ca213`.
  - `jpt4/prc` at `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
  - `jpt4/sjas` at `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Checked GitHub metadata and issues. `jpt4/as`, `jpt4/afs`, and `jpt4/sjas`
  had no listed issues; `jpt4/prc` had one closed typo issue.
- Attempted to retrieve the referenced X/Twitter status
  `https://x.com/jpt401/status/1556420237163118598`. The web fetch exposed no
  usable text, and web search did not surface a reliable mirror. Treat that
  reference as uncaptured until a better source is available.
- Added the first ADR-backed documentation scaffold so future work has a
  current public entrypoint, chronological log, durable context, subordinate
  review, and initial roadmap.

## 2026-05-16 - AFS Requirement Definition

- Re-read the live project `AGENTS.md` before continuing work. The active rules
  require ADRs before feature implementation, careful documentation layering,
  active forward motion, and structured tools where useful.
- Listed public repositories under `jpt4` and identified `jpt4/proflog` as a
  relevant adjacent executable frontier because SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md` records
  recent Proflog-side SJAS work.
- Cloned `jpt4/proflog` at `77af848`. The public main branch contains
  `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf`, but not the ADR-0063 through ADR-0068
  material described in the SJAS log.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm`; it failed at the embedded `P1` program definition
  with `Unbound variable: even`. Treat public Proflog main as relevant
  background, not as a passing executable dependency.
- Added `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/afs-requirements.md`, and
  `docs/adr/0002-afs-requirements.md` to turn AFS from a placeholder name into
  a concrete requirement matrix with a gap register and a recommended first
  executable probe.

## 2026-05-16 - Source Manifest

- Added `sources/manifest.json` to pin the reviewed source baseline for AS,
  AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent Proflog.
- Added `docs/source-manifest.md` and `docs/adr/0003-source-manifest.md` to
  explain the manifest, verification commands, and status of each source.
- Verified that `jq` is available for structural manifest checks.

## 2026-05-16 - Universal Cell Transition Probe

- Added ADR-0004 for the first code-bearing AS artifact: a tiny fixed-role
  Universal Cell transition probe.
- Wrote `tests/test_universal_cell.py` before implementation. The first run of
  `python -m unittest tests.test_universal_cell` failed with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autarkic_systems'`, confirming the red
  step.
- Implemented `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` with immutable `Cell` and
  `StepResult` records plus `step_fixed_cell`.
- Covered wire right-rotation, processor left-rotation and memory toggle,
  blocked output, upstream pull, stem-init reconfiguration, malformed input
  clearing, invalid role rejection, and invalid memory rejection.
- Added `tests/__init__.py` so the default fast command
  `python -m unittest discover` actually discovers the suite.
- Verified `python -m unittest discover`, `python -m py_compile
  autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py autarkic_systems/__init__.py
  tests/__init__.py tests/test_universal_cell.py`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-16 - Transition Predicate Bridge

- Added ADR-0005 for named predicates over Universal Cell transition results.
- Wrote `tests/test_transition_predicates.py` before implementation. The first
  targeted run failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'autarkic_systems.transition_predicates'`, confirming the red step.
- Implemented `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py` with
  `PredicateResult`, `output_not_overwritten`, `consumed_input_cleared`,
  `fixed_role_memory_rule`, and `stem_init_resets_to_stem`.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 16 tests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Literature Map And Open Problems

- Added `docs/adr/0006-literature-map.md` for the first literature/open-problem
  mapping slice.
- Added `docs/literature-map.md`, organizing AS, AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent
  Proflog/Fitting sources by their role in the AS project.
- Added `docs/open-problems.md`, ranking the next project questions from
  transition-claim formalization through hardware/schematic evidence.
- Corrected the roadmap's duplicate ADR-0005 heading by making the literature
  map ADR-0006.

## 2026-05-17 - Transition Claim Manifest

- Added ADR-0007 for a machine-readable bridge from transition predicate code
  to explicit AS claims.
- Wrote `tests/test_claim_manifest.py` before implementation. The first run
  failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'autarkic_systems.claim_manifest'`, confirming the red step.
- Added `claims/transition_claims.json` with four transition claims, each with
  positive and negative executable examples.
- Added `autarkic_systems/claim_manifest.py` to load and evaluate the manifest
  against implemented predicate functions.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_claim_manifest` passed 4 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 20 tests, `jq -e
  claims/transition_claims.json` passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Probe

- Added ADR-0008 for the first tested stem/reconfiguration slice.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail.py` before implementation. The first run
  failed because `step_stem_cell` did not exist, confirming the red step.
- Extended `Cell` with stem-state fields for `automail`, `control`, and
  `buffer`.
- Added `step_stem_cell` for the automail subset: `wr`, `wl`, `pr`, and `pl`
  reconfigure a stem cell into the corresponding fixed role and memory.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_automail` passed 8 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 28 tests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Claim

- Added ADR-0009 to promote stem automail behavior into the named AS claim
  surface.
- Wrote predicate tests before implementation. The first run failed because
  `automail_reconfigures_stem` did not exist, confirming the red step.
- Implemented `automail_reconfigures_stem` and added the
  `UC-STEM-AUTOMAIL-RECONFIGURES` claim to `claims/transition_claims.json`.
- The claim manifest evaluator initially caught a mismatch because
  `claim_manifest.py` was not preserving stem fields such as `automail` when
  parsing cells. Fixed the loader to parse automail, control, and buffer.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates` passed 10
  tests, `python -m unittest tests.test_claim_manifest` passed 4 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 30 tests, JSON checks passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Proof Apparatus Options

- Re-read `/home/sean/Projects/AGENTS.md`, the AS `AGENTS.md`, and the active
  thread goal before continuing. The project remains an open end-of-month AS
  work goal, and the live branch is `adr-0010-proof-apparatus-options`.
- Cloned and reviewed `namin/leanTAP` at
  `c17864a911c0c3cbd727b43743fdcb19b43714b8` because SJAS ISLA notes point to
  alphaLeanTAP as a possible tableaux direction.
- Reviewed the visible public Proflog source and the SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md`
  Proflog boundary notes again. Public Proflog remains relevant background, but
  it still does not expose the active ADR-006x frontier described by SJAS.
- Added ADR-0010 and `docs/proof-apparatus-options.md`. The decision is to
  start with a minimal AS-local proof-certificate checker for the current
  transition claims, use LeanTAP as a transparent design reference, and defer
  Proflog as a dependency until its active frontier is recovered or replaced.

## 2026-05-17 - Proof Certificate Checker

- Added ADR-0011 for the first proof-object layer over current transition
  claims.
- Wrote `tests/test_proof_certificates.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.proof_certificates` did not exist.
- Added `claims/proof_certificates.json` with one certificate per current
  transition claim. The first rule is `manifest-example`, tying proof steps to
  named claim examples and their expected predicate outcomes.
- Added `autarkic_systems/proof_certificates.py` to load certificates and
  reject missing claim certificates, unknown claims, unknown rules, missing
  examples, duplicate examples, and mismatched expectations.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_proof_certificates` passed 6 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 36 tests, py_compile passed for the new
  module and tests, JSON checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Transition Claim Object Language

- Added ADR-0012 for the first explicit AS object language.
- Wrote `tests/test_object_language.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.object_language` did not exist.
- Added `language/transition_claim_language.json` with explicit syntax classes
  for terms, formulae, sentences, proof objects, and substrate claims.
- Added `autarkic_systems/object_language.py` to validate the language manifest
  and the current transition-claim/proof-certificate surface.
- Added `docs/transition-claim-language.md` as the human-facing note for the
  language boundary.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_object_language` passed 6 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 42 tests, py_compile passed for the new
  module and tests, JSON checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Willard Definition Map

- Rechecked publication status before continuing. `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 42 tests, but `git push origin main ...` failed with `Permission to
  jpt4/as.git denied to Sean-Kenneth-Doherty`; the authenticated account has
  only read permission on `jpt4/as`.
- Restored the missing local SJAS witness checkout by cloning
  `https://github.com/jpt4/sjas.git` to `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/sjas`.
  The checkout resolved to the pinned commit
  `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Added ADR-0013 for P5: a definition-granularity Willard anchor map over
  Willard 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2020.
- Wrote `tests/test_willard_definition_map.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.willard_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/willard_definition_map.json` with anchors for the core
  definitions, constructions, theorem statements, and boundary results needed
  before AS can claim Willard-style formal confidence.
- Added `autarkic_systems/willard_map.py` to load and validate required source
  coverage, local SJAS PDF witnesses, unique anchor IDs/loci, and explicit AS
  relevance.
- Added `docs/willard-definition-map.md` as the human-facing guide to the
  anchor map.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_willard_definition_map` passed 4
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 46 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e . sources/willard_definition_map.json`
  passed, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Committed ADR-0013 as `854e345 Add Willard definition map`, fast-forwarded it
  into local `main`, and verified `python -m unittest discover` passed 46 tests
  on integrated `main`.
- Direct pushes of `adr-0013-willard-definition-map` and `main` to
  `https://github.com/jpt4/as.git` failed with 403 permission errors.
- Created the fork `https://github.com/Sean-Kenneth-Doherty/as` and pushed
  integrated `main` plus all ADR branches there.
- Opened upstream issue `https://github.com/jpt4/as/issues/1` to report the
  ready fork, latest commit, validation status, and blocked upstream push
  permission.

## 2026-05-17 - Proflog Source Status

- Added ADR-0014 for P6: decide whether public `jpt4/proflog` main can be an
  AS dependency.
- Checked the public Proflog remote. `git ls-remote
  https://github.com/jpt4/proflog.git HEAD refs/heads/*` exposed only `main` at
  `77af8481d9f41a439eb42e1d8268a5b39f7c5c33`.
- Rebuilt the disposable `_upstream` cache for SJAS and Proflog and confirmed
  public Proflog contains only `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf` as project
  payload.
- Compared public Proflog against `sjas/nachlass/LOG.md`; ADR-0063 through
  ADR-0068 terms such as `tableau-proof/3`, `subst-prf/4`, `subst-code/2`,
  `SelfCons1`, and `IS#_D(beta)` are present in the SJAS log but absent from
  public Proflog main.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm` in the public Proflog checkout. It failed at
  `proflog.scm:893:5` with `Unbound variable: even`.
- Wrote `tests/test_proflog_frontier_status.py` before adding the structured
  status artifact. The red run failed because
  `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json` and
  `docs/proflog-frontier-status.md`, recording the decision:
  `do-not-depend-on-public-main`.
- Adjusted the Willard-map fast validator to check pinned witness paths rather
  than requiring disposable `_upstream` clones to exist on every default test
  run.
- Opened `https://github.com/jpt4/proflog/issues/1` asking where the
  ADR-0063 through ADR-0068 source lives and whether public Proflog main should
  be treated as background only.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_willard_definition_map
  tests.test_proflog_frontier_status` passed 8 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 50 tests, py_compile passed for touched Python files, JSON
  checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - PRC Hardware Witness Map

- Added ADR-0015 for P7: define the PRC hardware/schematic witness path before
  drawing or simulating hardware.
- Refreshed the disposable PRC checkout at `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc`
  and reviewed PRC README criteria, GELC/RLEM geometry, switchable-circulator
  physical hypotheses, RALA/reconfiguration notes, the UC formal model, the
  ASM simulator, and schematic figure witnesses.
- Wrote `tests/test_prc_hardware_witness_map.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.prc_hardware_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json` with required witnesses for UC
  criteria, GELC geometry, RLEM literature, circulator physical hypotheses,
  RALA/reconfiguration pressure, the UC formal model, the ASM simulator, and
  PRC schematic figures.
- Added `autarkic_systems/prc_hardware_map.py` to load and validate required
  witness coverage, PRC-local path pinning, unique witness IDs/loci, AS
  relevance, simulation constraints, and next AS actions.
- Added `docs/prc-hardware-witness-map.md` as the human-facing guide. The
  recommended next artifact is
  `single-node-triangular-rlem-schematic-and-uc-transition-trace`.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons so P7 now points to the source-backed hardware witness layer.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_prc_hardware_witness_map` passed 4
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 54 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e .
  sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Single-Node Schematic Trace

- Added ADR-0016 for the first concrete artifact after the PRC hardware witness
  map: `single-node-triangular-rlem-schematic-and-uc-transition-trace`.
- Wrote `tests/test_single_node_schematic_trace.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace` did not exist.
- Added `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` with one triangular
  RLEM/Universal Cell key, north/east/west ports, four interpretive layers, all
  current AS `Cell` fields, and one fixed-role wire transition trace.
- Added `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` to load and validate the
  schematic trace against ADR-0015's witness map and replay the recorded
  transition through the existing Universal Cell probe.
- Added `docs/single-node-schematic-trace.md` as the human-facing explanation
  of the schematic key, layer boundaries, and executable trace.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, the PRC hardware
  witness note, ADR-0015 follow-up, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has a
  structured schematic trace rather than only a source witness map.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 62 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e .
  schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Single-Node Schematic SVG

- Added ADR-0017 for the first visible render of the structured single-node
  schematic trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_single_node_schematic_svg.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` to render a deterministic SVG from
  `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` and validate that a given
  SVG exactly matches renderer output.
- Added `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`, showing the
  triangular RLEM/Universal Cell node, north/east/west ports, right-memory
  routing, trace metadata, and interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/single-node-schematic-svg.md` as the human-facing render-boundary
  note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, ADR-0016 follow-up,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has a generated visual schematic view.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 7
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 69 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, XML parsing passed for
  `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Processor Memory Toggle Trace

- Added ADR-0018 for the second schematic-linked Universal Cell trace: a
  processor cell with left memory that routes a standard signal and toggles
  memory to right.
- Wrote `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `PROCESSOR_MEMORY_TOGGLE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was
  not yet exported from `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json` with the processor
  role, left-memory signal flow, expected output, complete AS `Cell` field
  mapping, PRC witness references, and expected memory toggle.
- Generalized `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` with
  `load_schematic_trace` and `validate_schematic_trace` while preserving the
  ADR-0016 single-node loader/validator wrappers.
- Added `docs/processor-memory-toggle-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, single-node trace
  note, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has both wire and processor
  schematic-linked traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_trace`
  passed 22 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 76 tests, py_compile
  passed for the touched module and new test, `jq -e .
  schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Reconfiguration Trace

- Added ADR-0019 for the first schematic-linked stem reconfiguration trace: a
  stem cell with `pl` automail reconfiguring into processor-left.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `STEM_AUTOMAIL_RECONFIGURATION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json` with the stem
  role, `pl` automail command, expected processor-left target, automail
  consumption, complete AS `Cell` field mapping, PRC witness references, and
  explicit automail reconfiguration flow.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` so generic trace validation
  distinguishes fixed-role signal routing from stem automail reconfiguration.
- Added `docs/stem-automail-reconfiguration-trace.md` as the human-facing
  trace boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, single-node trace
  note, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has wire, processor, and one stem
  automail schematic-linked trace.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_trace
  tests.test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace` passed 30 tests, `python -m
  unittest discover` passed 84 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module
  and new test, `jq -e .
  schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Processor Memory Toggle SVG

- Added ADR-0020 for rendering the ADR-0018 processor memory-toggle trace as a
  generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_svg.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `PROCESSOR_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Generalized `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with
  `render_schematic_svg` and `validate_schematic_svg` while preserving the
  ADR-0017 single-node wrappers.
- Added `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.svg`, showing the processor
  role, left-memory routing, before/after memory, trace metadata, and
  interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/processor-memory-toggle-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, processor trace note,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has generated SVG renders for both
  wire and processor fixed-role traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 14 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 91 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new
  test, XML parsing passed for both checked-in SVGs, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail SVG

- Added ADR-0021 for rendering the ADR-0019 stem automail reconfiguration trace
  as a generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail_svg.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `STEM_AUTOMAIL_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with the stem SVG artifact path
  and conditional reconfiguration summary fields for traces whose role or
  automail changes.
- Added `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.svg`, showing the stem
  role before transition, processor role after transition, memory before/after,
  automail consumption, trace metadata, and interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/stem-automail-reconfiguration-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem trace note,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has generated SVG renders for wire,
  processor, and stem automail traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_automail_svg
  tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg`
  passed 21 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 98 tests, py_compile
  passed for the touched module and new test, XML parsing passed for all three
  checked-in SVGs, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation

- Added ADR-0022 for the first standard-signal stem buffer subset from the PRC
  formal model.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because current `step_stem_cell` returned `idle` for one-hot
  standard-signal stem inputs.
- Extended `step_stem_cell` so a one-hot standard input selects the control
  rail, matching control input appends `1`, non-matching one-hot input appends
  `0`, full buffers report `stem-buffer-full` without consuming input, and
  malformed stem input is rejected and cleared.
- Preserved automail priority over standard-signal buffering.
- Updated `language/transition_claim_language.json` after the full suite caught
  that the object-language status vocabulary did not yet include the new stem
  buffer statuses.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation.md` as the human-facing subset and
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons so P2 no longer describes stem behavior as automail-only.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_buffer_accumulation
  tests.test_stem_automail` passed 14 tests, `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 104 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new test,
  `jq -e . language/transition_claim_language.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Claim

- Added ADR-0023 to promote ADR-0022 stem buffer accumulation into the named
  AS claim and proof-certificate surface.
- Wrote direct predicate tests before implementation. The red run failed
  because `stem_buffer_accumulates` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `stem_buffer_accumulates`, covering control-rail selection, matching
  and non-matching bit append, full-buffer boundary preservation, and
  malformed-input rejection for the ADR-0022 statuses.
- Added `UC-STEM-BUFFER-ACCUMULATES` to `claims/transition_claims.json` with
  positive control-selection, positive append, positive full-buffer-boundary,
  and negative wrong-bit examples.
- Added a `manifest-example` proof certificate for the new claim and updated
  `language/transition_claim_language.json` with the new predicate symbol.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-claim.md` and updated README, roadmap, literature
  map, open problems, transition-claim language note, project memory, and
  lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates
  tests.test_claim_manifest tests.test_proof_certificates
  tests.test_object_language` passed 31 tests, JSON checks passed for the
  claim/proof/language manifests, py_compile passed for the touched predicate
  module and test, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation Trace

- Added ADR-0024 for a schematic-linked trace of one matching-input stem buffer
  append.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `STEM_BUFFER_ACCUMULATION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was
  not yet exported from `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.json`, recording a stem cell
  with active control `[0, 1, 0]`, matching input `[0, 1, 0]`, and expected
  buffer append from `[0]` to `[0, 1]`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` so stem automail and stem
  buffer traces use separate alignment validation branches.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer note,
  project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_buffer_accumulation_trace
  tests.test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace` passed 16 tests, `python -m
  unittest discover` passed 117 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module
  and new test, `jq -e . schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.json`
  passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation SVG

- Added ADR-0025 for rendering the ADR-0024 stem buffer accumulation trace as a
  generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_svg.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `STEM_BUFFER_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with the stem buffer SVG
  artifact path and conditional control/buffer summary fields for traces whose
  buffer changes.
- Added `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.svg`, showing the active
  control rail, buffer before/after, cleared input, trace metadata, and
  interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer trace
  note, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_buffer_svg
  tests.test_stem_automail_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 28 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 124 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new

- Added ADR-0026 for a source-backed, structured map of PRC's five-bit stem
  command-buffer target/command encoding.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_command_buffer_map.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.stem_command_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/stem_command_buffer_map.json` with four target ranges, eight
  command offsets, PRC source witness metadata, and the AS bit-order convention
  `accumulated-msb-first`.
- Added `autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py` to load, validate, enumerate,
  and decode five-bit buffers without executing commands.
- Added `docs/stem-command-buffer-map.md` as the human-facing decoder boundary
  note.
- Added a refinement red step for noncanonical target-range and command-name
  maps; validation now rejects maps that merely cover values but change the
  PRC grouping or command identity.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer note,
  project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_command_buffer_map` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 132 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and test, `jq -e . sources/stem_command_buffer_map.json`

  structured source-status artifact. The red run failed because
  `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json`, recording the
  formal command table dependency, formal process-buffer execution anchor,
  legacy `raa.scm` target/command divergence, legacy semsim/fsmsim
  special-message divergence, and implementation blockers.
- Added `docs/stem-command-execution-source-status.md` as the human-facing
  blocking decision note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem command map
  note, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_command_execution_source_status`
  passed 4 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 136 tests, py_compile
  passed for the new test,
  `jq -e . sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Self Mailbox Representation

- Added ADR-0028 for explicit `Cell.self_mailbox` representation as the next
  allowed slice after ADR-0027.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_mailbox_representation.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `Cell` had no `self_mailbox` field and the language
  and schematic trace vocabularies did not name it.
- Added `self_mailbox` with the ADR-0026 command-message vocabulary to
  `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`.
- Updated claim manifest parsing, object-language validation, schematic trace
  mapping, `language/transition_claim_language.json`, and all checked

- Added ADR-0029 for representing ADR-0026 command-message tokens in Universal
  Cell channel tuples without executing command buffers.
- Wrote `tests/test_command_channel_tokens.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because command-message channel values were rejected and the
  object-language `signals` vocabulary did not list them.
- Expanded `Signal` and channel validation in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`
  to accept the eight command-message tokens.
- Updated `language/transition_claim_language.json` so `terms.signals` matches
  the expanded channel-token vocabulary.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, transition-claim
  language note, stem command execution source-status note, project memory, and
  lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_command_channel_tokens` passed 6
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 149 tests, py_compile passed for

  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 156 tests, py_compile passed for
  the touched module and new test, `jq -e .
  language/transition_claim_language.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

- Added ADR-0031 to promote the self-mailbox init-command execution subset
  into the named claim and proof-certificate surface.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_mailbox_init_claim.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `self_mailbox_executes_init_command` did not exist in
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `self_mailbox_executes_init_command`,
  `UC-STEM-SELF-MAILBOX-INIT-COMMAND`, proof-certificate coverage, and the
  transition-language predicate symbol.
- Refined the ADR-0028 default-preservation test so it checks omitted
  `self_mailbox` fields default to `_` while permitting explicit mailbox
  examples in later claims.

  note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, transition-claim
  language note, project memory, and lessons.

- Added ADR-0037 for the first narrow command-buffer-to-behavior path:
  just-completed self-target init-family command buffers.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_command_buffer_init_dispatch.py` before
  implementation. The red run showed self `proc-l-init` and self `stem-init`
  buffers only returned `stem-buffer-appended`, and the transition-language

- Added the narrow dispatch path in `step_stem_cell`, reusing the ADR-0026
  command map and ADR-0030 direct self-mailbox init semantics.
- Left neighbor-target buffers and self-target non-init buffers at the existing

  not exist in `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/self_command_buffer_init_trace.json` for the completed
  `self/proc-l-init` buffer `00101`.
- Added `SELF_COMMAND_BUFFER_INIT_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` and a dedicated
  `stem-command-buffer-self-processed` validation path so completed-buffer
  dispatch is not mistaken for ordinary stem buffer accumulation.
- Added `docs/self-command-buffer-init-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
