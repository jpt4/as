# Development Log

## 2026-05-16 - Initial Orientation Scaffold

- Cloned `https://github.com/jpt4/as` at commit
  `1a2fc06b75f5d33aee6655956c2a56df07a7bfb0`. The repository initially
  contained only `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md~`.
- Reviewed the project prelude in `AGENTS.md`: Autarkic Systems is an
  open-ended cross-disciplinary investigation that subsumes AFS, PRC, and
  SJAS, with a lower-bound objective of theory plus machinic implementation of
  an artificial entity demonstrating cognitive sovereignty.
- Fetched the three referenced subordinate repositories for review:
  - `jpt4/afs` at `a61592eab02a93d480149ce3465af5e3271ca213`.
  - `jpt4/prc` at `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
  - `jpt4/sjas` at `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Checked GitHub metadata and issues. `jpt4/as`, `jpt4/afs`, and `jpt4/sjas`
  had no listed issues; `jpt4/prc` had one closed typo issue.
- Attempted to retrieve the referenced X/Twitter status
  `https://x.com/jpt401/status/1556420237163118598`. The web fetch exposed no
  usable text, and web search did not surface a reliable mirror. Treat that
  reference as uncaptured until a better source is available.
- Added the first ADR-backed documentation scaffold so future work has a
  current public entrypoint, chronological log, durable context, subordinate
  review, and initial roadmap.

## 2026-05-16 - AFS Requirement Definition

- Re-read the live project `AGENTS.md` before continuing work. The active rules
  require ADRs before feature implementation, careful documentation layering,
  active forward motion, and structured tools where useful.
- Listed public repositories under `jpt4` and identified `jpt4/proflog` as a
  relevant adjacent executable frontier because SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md` records
  recent Proflog-side SJAS work.
- Cloned `jpt4/proflog` at `77af848`. The public main branch contains
  `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf`, but not the ADR-0063 through ADR-0068
  material described in the SJAS log.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm`; it failed at the embedded `P1` program definition
  with `Unbound variable: even`. Treat public Proflog main as relevant
  background, not as a passing executable dependency.
- Added `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/afs-requirements.md`, and
  `docs/adr/0002-afs-requirements.md` to turn AFS from a placeholder name into
  a concrete requirement matrix with a gap register and a recommended first
  executable probe.

## 2026-05-16 - Source Manifest

- Added `sources/manifest.json` to pin the reviewed source baseline for AS,
  AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent Proflog.
- Added `docs/source-manifest.md` and `docs/adr/0003-source-manifest.md` to
  explain the manifest, verification commands, and status of each source.
- Verified that `jq` is available for structural manifest checks.

## 2026-05-16 - Universal Cell Transition Probe

- Added ADR-0004 for the first code-bearing AS artifact: a tiny fixed-role
  Universal Cell transition probe.
- Wrote `tests/test_universal_cell.py` before implementation. The first run of
  `python -m unittest tests.test_universal_cell` failed with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autarkic_systems'`, confirming the red
  step.
- Implemented `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` with immutable `Cell` and
  `StepResult` records plus `step_fixed_cell`.
- Covered wire right-rotation, processor left-rotation and memory toggle,
  blocked output, upstream pull, stem-init reconfiguration, malformed input
  clearing, invalid role rejection, and invalid memory rejection.
- Added `tests/__init__.py` so the default fast command
  `python -m unittest discover` actually discovers the suite.
- Verified `python -m unittest discover`, `python -m py_compile
  autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py autarkic_systems/__init__.py
  tests/__init__.py tests/test_universal_cell.py`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-16 - Transition Predicate Bridge

- Added ADR-0005 for named predicates over Universal Cell transition results.
- Wrote `tests/test_transition_predicates.py` before implementation. The first
  targeted run failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'autarkic_systems.transition_predicates'`, confirming the red step.
- Implemented `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py` with
  `PredicateResult`, `output_not_overwritten`, `consumed_input_cleared`,
  `fixed_role_memory_rule`, and `stem_init_resets_to_stem`.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 16 tests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Literature Map And Open Problems

- Added `docs/adr/0006-literature-map.md` for the first literature/open-problem
  mapping slice.
- Added `docs/literature-map.md`, organizing AS, AFS, PRC, SJAS, and adjacent
  Proflog/Fitting sources by their role in the AS project.
- Added `docs/open-problems.md`, ranking the next project questions from
  transition-claim formalization through hardware/schematic evidence.
- Corrected the roadmap's duplicate ADR-0005 heading by making the literature
  map ADR-0006.

## 2026-05-17 - Transition Claim Manifest

- Added ADR-0007 for a machine-readable bridge from transition predicate code
  to explicit AS claims.
- Wrote `tests/test_claim_manifest.py` before implementation. The first run
  failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'autarkic_systems.claim_manifest'`, confirming the red step.
- Added `claims/transition_claims.json` with four transition claims, each with
  positive and negative executable examples.
- Added `autarkic_systems/claim_manifest.py` to load and evaluate the manifest
  against implemented predicate functions.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_claim_manifest` passed 4 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 20 tests, `jq -e
  claims/transition_claims.json` passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Probe

- Added ADR-0008 for the first tested stem/reconfiguration slice.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail.py` before implementation. The first run
  failed because `step_stem_cell` did not exist, confirming the red step.
- Extended `Cell` with stem-state fields for `automail`, `control`, and
  `buffer`.
- Added `step_stem_cell` for the automail subset: `wr`, `wl`, `pr`, and `pl`
  reconfigure a stem cell into the corresponding fixed role and memory.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_automail` passed 8 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 28 tests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Claim

- Added ADR-0009 to promote stem automail behavior into the named AS claim
  surface.
- Wrote predicate tests before implementation. The first run failed because
  `automail_reconfigures_stem` did not exist, confirming the red step.
- Implemented `automail_reconfigures_stem` and added the
  `UC-STEM-AUTOMAIL-RECONFIGURES` claim to `claims/transition_claims.json`.
- The claim manifest evaluator initially caught a mismatch because
  `claim_manifest.py` was not preserving stem fields such as `automail` when
  parsing cells. Fixed the loader to parse automail, control, and buffer.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates` passed 10
  tests, `python -m unittest tests.test_claim_manifest` passed 4 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 30 tests, JSON checks passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Proof Apparatus Options

- Re-read `/home/sean/Projects/AGENTS.md`, the AS `AGENTS.md`, and the active
  thread goal before continuing. The project remains an open end-of-month AS
  work goal, and the live branch is `adr-0010-proof-apparatus-options`.
- Cloned and reviewed `namin/leanTAP` at
  `c17864a911c0c3cbd727b43743fdcb19b43714b8` because SJAS ISLA notes point to
  alphaLeanTAP as a possible tableaux direction.
- Reviewed the visible public Proflog source and the SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md`
  Proflog boundary notes again. Public Proflog remains relevant background, but
  it still does not expose the active ADR-006x frontier described by SJAS.
- Added ADR-0010 and `docs/proof-apparatus-options.md`. The decision is to
  start with a minimal AS-local proof-certificate checker for the current
  transition claims, use LeanTAP as a transparent design reference, and defer
  Proflog as a dependency until its active frontier is recovered or replaced.

## 2026-05-17 - Proof Certificate Checker

- Added ADR-0011 for the first proof-object layer over current transition
  claims.
- Wrote `tests/test_proof_certificates.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.proof_certificates` did not exist.
- Added `claims/proof_certificates.json` with one certificate per current
  transition claim. The first rule is `manifest-example`, tying proof steps to
  named claim examples and their expected predicate outcomes.
- Added `autarkic_systems/proof_certificates.py` to load certificates and
  reject missing claim certificates, unknown claims, unknown rules, missing
  examples, duplicate examples, and mismatched expectations.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_proof_certificates` passed 6 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 36 tests, py_compile passed for the new
  module and tests, JSON checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Transition Claim Object Language

- Added ADR-0012 for the first explicit AS object language.
- Wrote `tests/test_object_language.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.object_language` did not exist.
- Added `language/transition_claim_language.json` with explicit syntax classes
  for terms, formulae, sentences, proof objects, and substrate claims.
- Added `autarkic_systems/object_language.py` to validate the language manifest
  and the current transition-claim/proof-certificate surface.
- Added `docs/transition-claim-language.md` as the human-facing note for the
  language boundary.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_object_language` passed 6 tests,
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 42 tests, py_compile passed for the new
  module and tests, JSON checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Willard Definition Map

- Rechecked publication status before continuing. `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 42 tests, but `git push origin main ...` failed with `Permission to
  jpt4/as.git denied to Sean-Kenneth-Doherty`; the authenticated account has
  only read permission on `jpt4/as`.
- Restored the missing local SJAS witness checkout by cloning
  `https://github.com/jpt4/sjas.git` to `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/sjas`.
  The checkout resolved to the pinned commit
  `f1c11af5f310d39f487c3b91ee1ca70f4ade8871`.
- Added ADR-0013 for P5: a definition-granularity Willard anchor map over
  Willard 2001, 2011, 2016, and 2020.
- Wrote `tests/test_willard_definition_map.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.willard_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/willard_definition_map.json` with anchors for the core
  definitions, constructions, theorem statements, and boundary results needed
  before AS can claim Willard-style formal confidence.
- Added `autarkic_systems/willard_map.py` to load and validate required source
  coverage, local SJAS PDF witnesses, unique anchor IDs/loci, and explicit AS
  relevance.
- Added `docs/willard-definition-map.md` as the human-facing guide to the
  anchor map.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_willard_definition_map` passed 4
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 46 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e . sources/willard_definition_map.json`
  passed, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Committed ADR-0013 as `854e345 Add Willard definition map`, fast-forwarded it
  into local `main`, and verified `python -m unittest discover` passed 46 tests
  on integrated `main`.
- Direct pushes of `adr-0013-willard-definition-map` and `main` to
  `https://github.com/jpt4/as.git` failed with 403 permission errors.
- Created the fork `https://github.com/Sean-Kenneth-Doherty/as` and pushed
  integrated `main` plus all ADR branches there.
- Opened upstream issue `https://github.com/jpt4/as/issues/1` to report the
  ready fork, latest commit, validation status, and blocked upstream push
  permission.

## 2026-05-17 - Proflog Source Status

- Added ADR-0014 for P6: decide whether public `jpt4/proflog` main can be an
  AS dependency.
- Checked the public Proflog remote. `git ls-remote
  https://github.com/jpt4/proflog.git HEAD refs/heads/*` exposed only `main` at
  `77af8481d9f41a439eb42e1d8268a5b39f7c5c33`.
- Rebuilt the disposable `_upstream` cache for SJAS and Proflog and confirmed
  public Proflog contains only `proflog.scm` and `LPTableaus.pdf` as project
  payload.
- Compared public Proflog against `sjas/nachlass/LOG.md`; ADR-0063 through
  ADR-0068 terms such as `tableau-proof/3`, `subst-prf/4`, `subst-code/2`,
  `SelfCons1`, and `IS#_D(beta)` are present in the SJAS log but absent from
  public Proflog main.
- Ran `guile proflog.scm` in the public Proflog checkout. It failed at
  `proflog.scm:893:5` with `Unbound variable: even`.
- Wrote `tests/test_proflog_frontier_status.py` before adding the structured
  status artifact. The red run failed because
  `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json` and
  `docs/proflog-frontier-status.md`, recording the decision:
  `do-not-depend-on-public-main`.
- Adjusted the Willard-map fast validator to check pinned witness paths rather
  than requiring disposable `_upstream` clones to exist on every default test
  run.
- Opened `https://github.com/jpt4/proflog/issues/1` asking where the
  ADR-0063 through ADR-0068 source lives and whether public Proflog main should
  be treated as background only.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_willard_definition_map
  tests.test_proflog_frontier_status` passed 8 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 50 tests, py_compile passed for touched Python files, JSON
  checks passed, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - PRC Hardware Witness Map

- Added ADR-0015 for P7: define the PRC hardware/schematic witness path before
  drawing or simulating hardware.
- Refreshed the disposable PRC checkout at `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc`
  and reviewed PRC README criteria, GELC/RLEM geometry, switchable-circulator
  physical hypotheses, RALA/reconfiguration notes, the UC formal model, the
  ASM simulator, and schematic figure witnesses.
- Wrote `tests/test_prc_hardware_witness_map.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.prc_hardware_map` did not exist.
- Added `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json` with required witnesses for UC
  criteria, GELC geometry, RLEM literature, circulator physical hypotheses,
  RALA/reconfiguration pressure, the UC formal model, the ASM simulator, and
  PRC schematic figures.
- Added `autarkic_systems/prc_hardware_map.py` to load and validate required
  witness coverage, PRC-local path pinning, unique witness IDs/loci, AS
  relevance, simulation constraints, and next AS actions.
- Added `docs/prc-hardware-witness-map.md` as the human-facing guide. The
  recommended next artifact is
  `single-node-triangular-rlem-schematic-and-uc-transition-trace`.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons so P7 now points to the source-backed hardware witness layer.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_prc_hardware_witness_map` passed 4
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 54 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e .
  sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Single-Node Schematic Trace

- Added ADR-0016 for the first concrete artifact after the PRC hardware witness
  map: `single-node-triangular-rlem-schematic-and-uc-transition-trace`.
- Wrote `tests/test_single_node_schematic_trace.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace` did not exist.
- Added `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` with one triangular
  RLEM/Universal Cell key, north/east/west ports, four interpretive layers, all
  current AS `Cell` fields, and one fixed-role wire transition trace.
- Added `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` to load and validate the
  schematic trace against ADR-0015's witness map and replay the recorded
  transition through the existing Universal Cell probe.
- Added `docs/single-node-schematic-trace.md` as the human-facing explanation
  of the schematic key, layer boundaries, and executable trace.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, the PRC hardware
  witness note, ADR-0015 follow-up, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has a
  structured schematic trace rather than only a source witness map.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 62 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, `jq -e .
  schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Single-Node Schematic SVG

- Added ADR-0017 for the first visible render of the structured single-node
  schematic trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_single_node_schematic_svg.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` to render a deterministic SVG from
  `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json` and validate that a given
  SVG exactly matches renderer output.
- Added `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`, showing the
  triangular RLEM/Universal Cell node, north/east/west ports, right-memory
  routing, trace metadata, and interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/single-node-schematic-svg.md` as the human-facing render-boundary
  note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, ADR-0016 follow-up,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has a generated visual schematic view.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 7
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 69 tests, py_compile passed for
  the new module and tests, XML parsing passed for
  `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Processor Memory Toggle Trace

- Added ADR-0018 for the second schematic-linked Universal Cell trace: a
  processor cell with left memory that routes a standard signal and toggles
  memory to right.
- Wrote `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `PROCESSOR_MEMORY_TOGGLE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was
  not yet exported from `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json` with the processor
  role, left-memory signal flow, expected output, complete AS `Cell` field
  mapping, PRC witness references, and expected memory toggle.
- Generalized `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` with
  `load_schematic_trace` and `validate_schematic_trace` while preserving the
  ADR-0016 single-node loader/validator wrappers.
- Added `docs/processor-memory-toggle-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, single-node trace
  note, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has both wire and processor
  schematic-linked traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_trace`
  passed 22 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 76 tests, py_compile
  passed for the touched module and new test, `jq -e .
  schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json` passed, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail Reconfiguration Trace

- Added ADR-0019 for the first schematic-linked stem reconfiguration trace: a
  stem cell with `pl` automail reconfiguring into processor-left.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `STEM_AUTOMAIL_RECONFIGURATION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json` with the stem
  role, `pl` automail command, expected processor-left target, automail
  consumption, complete AS `Cell` field mapping, PRC witness references, and
  explicit automail reconfiguration flow.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` so generic trace validation
  distinguishes fixed-role signal routing from stem automail reconfiguration.
- Added `docs/stem-automail-reconfiguration-trace.md` as the human-facing
  trace boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, single-node trace
  note, project memory, and lessons so P7 now has wire, processor, and one stem
  automail schematic-linked trace.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_single_node_schematic_trace
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_trace
  tests.test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace` passed 30 tests, `python -m
  unittest discover` passed 84 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module
  and new test, `jq -e .
  schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Processor Memory Toggle SVG

- Added ADR-0020 for rendering the ADR-0018 processor memory-toggle trace as a
  generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_svg.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `PROCESSOR_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Generalized `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with
  `render_schematic_svg` and `validate_schematic_svg` while preserving the
  ADR-0017 single-node wrappers.
- Added `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.svg`, showing the processor
  role, left-memory routing, before/after memory, trace metadata, and
  interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/processor-memory-toggle-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, processor trace note,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has generated SVG renders for both
  wire and processor fixed-role traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg
  tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg` passed 14 tests, `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 91 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new
  test, XML parsing passed for both checked-in SVGs, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Automail SVG

- Added ADR-0021 for rendering the ADR-0019 stem automail reconfiguration trace
  as a generated SVG while keeping the JSON trace authoritative.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_automail_svg.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `STEM_AUTOMAIL_SVG_ARTIFACT` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` with the stem SVG artifact path
  and conditional reconfiguration summary fields for traces whose role or
  automail changes.
- Added `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.svg`, showing the stem
  role before transition, processor role after transition, memory before/after,
  automail consumption, trace metadata, and interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/stem-automail-reconfiguration-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem trace note,
  project memory, and lessons so P7 now has generated SVG renders for wire,
  processor, and stem automail traces.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_automail_svg
  tests.test_processor_memory_toggle_svg tests.test_single_node_schematic_svg`
  passed 21 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 98 tests, py_compile
  passed for the touched module and new test, XML parsing passed for all three
  checked-in SVGs, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation

- Added ADR-0022 for the first standard-signal stem buffer subset from the PRC
  formal model.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because current `step_stem_cell` returned `idle` for one-hot
  standard-signal stem inputs.
- Extended `step_stem_cell` so a one-hot standard input selects the control
  rail, matching control input appends `1`, non-matching one-hot input appends
  `0`, full buffers report `stem-buffer-full` without consuming input, and
  malformed stem input is rejected and cleared.
- Preserved automail priority over standard-signal buffering.
- Updated `language/transition_claim_language.json` after the full suite caught
  that the object-language status vocabulary did not yet include the new stem
  buffer statuses.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation.md` as the human-facing subset and
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons so P2 no longer describes stem behavior as automail-only.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_buffer_accumulation
  tests.test_stem_automail` passed 14 tests, `python -m unittest discover`
  passed 104 tests, py_compile passed for the touched module and new test,
  `jq -e . language/transition_claim_language.json` passed, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Claim

- Added ADR-0023 to promote ADR-0022 stem buffer accumulation into the named
  AS claim and proof-certificate surface.
- Wrote direct predicate tests before implementation. The red run failed
  because `stem_buffer_accumulates` was not yet exported from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `stem_buffer_accumulates`, covering control-rail selection, matching
  and non-matching bit append, full-buffer boundary preservation, and
  malformed-input rejection for the ADR-0022 statuses.
- Added `UC-STEM-BUFFER-ACCUMULATES` to `claims/transition_claims.json` with
  positive control-selection, positive append, positive full-buffer-boundary,
  and negative wrong-bit examples.
- Added a `manifest-example` proof certificate for the new claim and updated
  `language/transition_claim_language.json` with the new predicate symbol.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-claim.md` and updated README, roadmap, literature
  map, open problems, transition-claim language note, project memory, and
  lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_transition_predicates
  tests.test_claim_manifest tests.test_proof_certificates
  tests.test_object_language` passed 31 tests, JSON checks passed for the
  claim/proof/language manifests, py_compile passed for the touched predicate
  module and test, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Stem Buffer Accumulation Trace

- Added ADR-0024 for a schematic-linked trace of one matching-input stem buffer
  append.
- Wrote `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `STEM_BUFFER_ACCUMULATION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was
  not yet exported from `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.json`, recording a stem cell
  with active control `[0, 1, 0]`, matching input `[0, 1, 0]`, and expected
  buffer append from `[0]` to `[0, 1]`.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` so stem automail and stem
  buffer traces use separate alignment validation branches.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation-trace.md` as the human-facing trace
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer note,
  project memory, and lessons.

  artifact path and conditional control/buffer summary fields for traces whose
  buffer changes.
- Added `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.svg`, showing the active
  control rail, buffer before/after, cleared input, trace metadata, and
  interpretive layer IDs.
- Added `docs/stem-buffer-accumulation-svg.md` as the human-facing render
  boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer trace
  note, project memory, and lessons.

  command offsets, PRC source witness metadata, and the AS bit-order convention
  `accumulated-msb-first`.
- Added `autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py` to load, validate, enumerate,
  and decode five-bit buffers without executing commands.
- Added `docs/stem-command-buffer-map.md` as the human-facing decoder boundary
  note.
- Added a refinement red step for noncanonical target-range and command-name
  maps; validation now rejects maps that merely cover values but change the
  PRC grouping or command identity.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem buffer note,
  project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_command_buffer_map` passed 8
  tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 132 tests, py_compile passed for

  structured source-status artifact. The red run failed because
  `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json`, recording the
  formal command table dependency, formal process-buffer execution anchor,
  legacy `raa.scm` target/command divergence, legacy semsim/fsmsim

  note, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_stem_command_execution_source_status`
  passed 4 tests, `python -m unittest discover` passed 136 tests, py_compile
  passed for the new test,
  `jq -e . sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json` passed, and

- Added ADR-0028 for explicit `Cell.self_mailbox` representation as the next
  allowed slice after ADR-0027.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_mailbox_representation.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `Cell` had no `self_mailbox` field and the language
  and schematic trace vocabularies did not name it.
- Added `self_mailbox` with the ADR-0026 command-message vocabulary to
  `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`.

  run failed because command-message channel values were rejected and the
  object-language `signals` vocabulary did not list them.
- Expanded `Signal` and channel validation in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`
  to accept the eight command-message tokens.
- Updated `language/transition_claim_language.json` so `terms.signals` matches
  the expanded channel-token vocabulary.

  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `self_mailbox_executes_init_command`,
  `UC-STEM-SELF-MAILBOX-INIT-COMMAND`, proof-certificate coverage, and the

  validation path so neighbor delivery traces are not mistaken for ordinary
  stem buffer accumulation.
- Added `docs/neighbor-command-buffer-delivery-trace.md` as the human-facing
  trace boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem command
  execution source-status note/artifact, and project memory.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_trace`
  passed 9 tests and the adjacent trace/claim/source-status/object-language
  suite passed 35 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 267 tests,
  py_compile passed for the touched Python module and tests, JSON parsing
  passed for the source-status and neighbor-delivery trace manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Command Buffer Delivery SVG

- Added ADR-0047 for a generated SVG render of the neighbor command-buffer
  delivery trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_svg.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `NEIGHBOR_COMMAND_BUFFER_DELIVERY_SVG_ARTIFACT` did not exist in
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `NEIGHBOR_COMMAND_BUFFER_DELIVERY_SVG_ARTIFACT` and a renderer summary
  branch that exposes the delivered output channel and cleared command state
  before generic buffer summaries.
- Generated `schematics/neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Added `docs/neighbor-command-buffer-delivery-svg.md` as the human-facing
  render boundary note.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, stem command
  execution source-status note/artifact, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified `python -m unittest tests.test_neighbor_command_buffer_delivery_svg`
  passed 7 tests and the adjacent SVG/trace/source-status/object-language
  suite passed 36 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 274 tests,
  py_compile passed for the touched Python module and tests, JSON parsing
  passed for the source-status and neighbor-delivery trace manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Command Consumption Source Status

- Added ADR-0048 to decide the recipient-side command-message consumption
  frontier from PRC sources before changing runtime behavior.
- Restored the disposable PRC source cache by cloning
  `https://github.com/jpt4/prc.git` to `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc`.
  The checkout is at manifest-pinned commit
  `7e82c73fac8f108faac801a5c65e2c2b92653ba5`.
- Inspected the formal model input-channel `process-special-message` anchor
  and legacy RAA/FSM/Sem simulator special-message sets.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_command_consumption_source_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/recipient_command_consumption_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/recipient_command_consumption_source_status.json` and
  `docs/recipient-command-consumption-source-status.md`.
- Updated the stem command execution source-status artifact so the next
  executable slice is recipient-side init-family command-message consumption,
  while `standard-signal`, write-buffer, and multi-command input policy remain
  blocked.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and
  lessons.
- Verified
  `python -m unittest tests.test_recipient_command_consumption_source_status`
  passed 5 tests and the adjacent stem source-status suite passed 9 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 279 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient and stem source-status
  manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message Consumption

- Added ADR-0049 for the first executable recipient-side command-message
  slice: single init-family input-channel command messages only.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_messages.py` before implementation
  and updated adjacent command-token, neighbor-delivery, and source-status
  tests. The red run over the focused suite failed with ten failures and one
  error because init-family command-message inputs still returned
  `rejected-input`, the transition language lacked
  `recipient-init-command-message-processed`, and the source-status artifacts
  still described the slice as future work.
- Updated `step_fixed_cell` and `step_stem_cell` to consume one
  `stem-init`, `wire-r-init`, `wire-l-init`, `proc-r-init`, or `proc-l-init`
  command-message input. The implementation reuses the self-mailbox
  role/memory target map, clears command state, handles pulled upstream command
  messages on fixed cells, and preserves rejection for `standard-signal`,
  write-buffer, and multi-command inputs.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-consumption.md` and updated the
  recipient and stem source-status artifacts, transition language, README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused recipient/adjacent suite passed 28 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 286 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched Python module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the transition
  language and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message Claim

- Added ADR-0050 to promote the ADR-0049 recipient init command-message
  behavior into the named transition-claim and proof-certificate surface.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_message_claim.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `recipient_init_command_message_processed` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `recipient_init_command_message_processed` to
  `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`. The predicate covers fixed
  direct input, fixed pulled-upstream input, and stem direct input for the
  init-family command-message subset. It checks target role/memory, cleared
  input/output, cleared command state, and source-specific upstream handling.
- Added `UC-RECIPIENT-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-PROCESSED` to
  `claims/transition_claims.json`, added the matching proof-certificate entry,
  and updated the transition-claim object language.
- Updated the recipient and stem source-status artifacts so the next slice is
  a schematic-linked recipient init command-message trace rather than claim
  promotion.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-claim.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused claim/source-status/predicate suite passed 38 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 293 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched predicate module and tests, JSON parsing passed for claim,
  certificate, language, and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message Trace

- Added ADR-0051 for a schematic-linked trace over the ADR-0050 recipient init
  command-message claim.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_message_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` and a dedicated
  recipient init command-message alignment validator to
  `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py`.
- Added `schematics/recipient_init_command_message_trace.json`, replaying one
  fixed processor-left recipient that pulls upstream `wire-r-init`, processes
  it as a recipient init command message, and becomes wire-right with upstream
  and command state cleared.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-trace.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, recipient/stem source-status
  artifacts, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused trace/source-status/schematic suite passed 44 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 302 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched schematic module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient
  trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Command-Message SVG

- Added ADR-0052 for the rendered SVG view of the ADR-0051 recipient init
  command-message trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_command_message_svg.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_SVG_ARTIFACT` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `RECIPIENT_INIT_COMMAND_MESSAGE_SVG_ARTIFACT` and a recipient init
  command-message summary branch to `render_schematic_svg()`, exposing
  upstream before/after, recipient role/memory after, cleared input/output,
  empty self-mailbox, and cleared control/buffer state.
- Generated `schematics/recipient_init_command_message_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-command-message-svg.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, recipient/stem source-status
  artifacts, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused recipient SVG/trace/source-status suite passed 39
  tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 309 tests, py_compile passed for
  the touched SVG renderer and tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient
  trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Source Status

- Added ADR-0053 to decide the recipient-side non-init command-message
  frontier before changing runtime behavior.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_source_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`, blocking
  recipient-side `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, `write-buf-one`, and
  multi-command input execution.
- Recorded the formal/legacy `standard-signal` divergence and the RAA,
  SEMSIM, and FSMSIM write-buffer clearing/buffer-behavior divergences.
- Updated recipient and stem source-status frontiers so the next safe slice is
  a named non-init command-message rejection-boundary claim, not execution.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-source-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused recipient non-init/source-status suite passed 14 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 314 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched source-status tests, JSON parsing passed for the recipient non-init,
  recipient consumption, and stem source-status manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Rejection Claim

- Added ADR-0054 to promote the ADR-0053 recipient non-init command-message
  rejection boundary into the named transition-claim and proof-certificate
  surface.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_rejection_claim.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.transition_predicates`.
- Added `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected` to
  `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`. The predicate covers fixed
  direct non-init rejection, fixed pulled-upstream non-init rejection, and stem
  multi-command conflict rejection.
- Added `UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED` to
  `claims/transition_claims.json`, added the matching proof-certificate entry,
  and updated the transition-claim object language.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice is a schematic-linked rejection trace, not
  claim promotion or execution.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-rejection-claim.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused rejection-claim/source-status/predicate suite passed
  37 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 322 tests, py_compile passed
  for the touched predicate module and tests, JSON parsing passed for claim,
  certificate, language, and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Rejection Trace

- Added ADR-0055 to make one recipient non-init command-message rejection
  visible as a schematic-linked executable trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_NON_INIT_COMMAND_REJECTION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added the artifact identity, validation alignment, and
  `schematics/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.json` for a fixed
  processor-left recipient rejecting upstream `standard-signal` on channel 1.
- The trace preserves role and memory, clears upstream/input/output command
  state, satisfies `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected`, and does not
  execute the blocked command.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice is a rendered SVG for the rejection trace.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-rejection-trace.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused rejection-trace/source-status suite passed 41 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 332 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched schematic module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the rejection
  trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Non-Init Command Rejection SVG

- Added ADR-0056 for the rendered SVG view of the ADR-0055 recipient non-init
  command-message rejection trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_non_init_command_rejection_svg.py` before
  implementation. The first red run failed because
  `RECIPIENT_NON_INIT_COMMAND_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `RECIPIENT_NON_INIT_COMMAND_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` and a recipient
  non-init rejection summary branch to `render_schematic_svg()`, exposing
  upstream before/after, role/memory preservation, cleared input/output,
  empty self-mailbox, and preserved control/buffer state.
- Generated `schematics/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice moves from rejection evidence to source
  resolution for write-buffer, standard-signal, and multi-command semantics.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-command-rejection-svg.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused rejection-SVG/source-status suite passed 31 tests and
  the full SVG suite passed 77 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed
  339 tests, py_compile passed for the touched SVG renderer and tests, JSON
  parsing passed for the source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Write-Buffer Command Semantics Status

- Added ADR-0057 to decide whether `write-buf-zero` and `write-buf-one`
  command execution is source-backed enough to implement.
- Wrote `tests/test_write_buffer_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`, keeping
  write-buffer command execution blocked across recipient command-message,
  self-mailbox, and self-target command-buffer surfaces.
- Recorded the formal-model gap: write-buffer commands are named in the
  command table and special-message paths, but no executable write-buffer
  primitive or clearing/buffer-full boundary is defined.
- Recorded the legacy divergence: RAA appends with a buffer-full guard, SEMSIM
  appends then clears the buffer through its stem wrapper, and FSMSIM appends
  while clearing self-mailbox/input state without the same buffer-full guard.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice moves to `standard-signal` source
  resolution and multi-command conflict policy.
- Added `docs/write-buffer-command-semantics-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused write-buffer/source-status suite passed 19 tests.

- Added ADR-0058 to decide whether `standard-signal` command-token execution
  is source-backed enough to implement.
- Wrote `tests/test_standard_signal_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json`, keeping
  `standard-signal` command-token execution blocked across recipient
  command-message, self-mailbox, and self-target command-buffer surfaces.
- Recorded the formal-model split: ordinary standard-signal behavior is
  binary-input high-rail/routing behavior, while the command table also names
  `standard-signal` at command offset 0 without defining command-token
  execution semantics.
- Recorded the legacy divergence: RAA excludes `standard-signal` from
  `special-messages` but maps the final command-buffer case to it, while
  SEMSIM and FSMSIM exclude it from special messages and classify standard
  input separately.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, and stem source-status
  artifacts so the next safe slice moves to multi-command recipient input
  conflict policy.
- Added `docs/standard-signal-command-semantics-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused standard-signal/write-buffer/source-status suite passed
  24 tests. `python -m unittest discover` passed 349 tests, py_compile passed
  for the touched source-status tests, JSON parsing passed for the
  standard-signal, write-buffer, recipient, and stem source-status manifests,
  and `git diff --check` passed.

- Added ADR-0059 to select a policy for multiple simultaneous recipient
  command-message inputs.
- Wrote `tests/test_multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.json` did not exist.
- Added `sources/multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.json`, selecting
  reject-and-clear for two or more recipient command-message tokens and
  confirming no priority or sequencing rule is inferred.
- Verified existing runtime behavior for fixed direct conflicts, fixed
  upstream conflicts, and stem direct conflicts without changing
  `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`.
- Added a fixed all-init command conflict example to
  `UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED` and added matching
  proof-certificate coverage.
- Updated recipient non-init, recipient consumption, write-buffer,
  standard-signal, and stem source-status artifacts so the next safe slice is
  a schematic-linked multi-command rejection trace.
- Added `docs/multi-command-recipient-input-policy-status.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused multi-command/source-status/claim suite passed 46 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 353 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched source-status and claim tests, JSON parsing passed for the
  multi-command, standard-signal, write-buffer, recipient, stem, claim, and
  certificate manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Multi-Command Recipient Rejection Trace

- Added ADR-0060 to make the ADR-0059 reject-and-clear policy visible as a
  schematic-linked trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_multi_command_recipient_rejection_trace.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_trace`.
- Added `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` and routed the
  new artifact through the existing recipient non-init rejection alignment
  validator.
- Added `schematics/multi_command_recipient_rejection_trace.json`, replaying a
  fixed `wire/right` recipient rejecting simultaneous `wire-r-init` and
  `proc-l-init` command-message inputs.
- Verified the trace replays through `step_fixed_cell`, satisfies
  `recipient_non_init_command_message_rejected`, validates against the PRC
  hardware witness map, and rejects drifted flow or uncleared input.
- Updated source-status frontiers so the next safe slice is a rendered SVG for
  the multi-command rejection trace.
- Added `docs/multi-command-recipient-rejection-trace.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused multi-command trace/source-status suite passed 37 tests.
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 362 tests, py_compile passed for the
  touched schematic trace module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the
  multi-command trace and source-status manifests, and `git diff --check`
  passed.

- Added ADR-0061 for a generated SVG render of the ADR-0060 multi-command
  recipient rejection trace.
- Wrote `tests/test_multi_command_recipient_rejection_svg.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.schematic_svg`.
- Added `MULTI_COMMAND_RECIPIENT_REJECTION_SVG_ARTIFACT` and routed the
  multi-command trace through the existing recipient non-init rejection SVG
  summary branch.
- Generated `schematics/multi_command_recipient_rejection_trace.svg` from
  `render_schematic_svg()`.
- Updated source-status frontiers so the current multi-command rejection
  evidence ladder is complete and the next command-execution work returns to
  source resolution for `standard-signal` or write-buffer semantics.
- Added `docs/multi-command-recipient-rejection-svg.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused multi-command SVG test passed 7 tests, the adjacent
  multi-command/source-status suite passed 44 tests, and `python -m unittest
  discover` passed 369 tests. `py_compile` passed for the touched renderer and
  tests, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests and trace,
  and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Guile ASMSIM Command Semantics Status

- Added ADR-0062 after scanning the local PRC source tree for evidence that
  might resolve `standard-signal` or write-buffer command-token semantics.
- Wrote `tests/test_guile_asmsim_command_semantics_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/guile_asmsim_command_semantics_status.json` was absent.
- Added `sources/guile_asmsim_command_semantics_status.json`, recording
  `practice/legacy/guile-asmsim.scm` as blocker-strengthening evidence rather
  than runtime authority: init-family-only `special-messages`, binary
  `write-buf`, self-mailbox numeric append, and a divergent command-list
  expression.
- Cross-linked the evidence from the standard-signal, write-buffer, and stem
  command source-status artifacts.
- Added `docs/guile-asmsim-command-semantics-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.

  adjacent command source-status suite passed 29 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 374 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new test, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests, and

## 2026-05-17 - ASMSIM Process-Buffer Status

- Added ADR-0063 after reviewing `practice/asmsim.scm` as the next local PRC
  source that might resolve blocked `standard-signal` or write-buffer
  command-token semantics.
- Wrote `tests/test_asmsim_process_buffer_status.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `sources/asmsim_process_buffer_status.json` was
  absent.
- Added `sources/asmsim_process_buffer_status.json`, recording
  `practice/asmsim.scm` as blocker-strengthening process-buffer evidence:
  the source says the process-buffer branch needs documentation, warns to
  confirm message-list codes, uses code-shape predicates, and contains a
  literal `msg-list` placeholder.
- Cross-linked the evidence from the standard-signal, write-buffer, and stem
  command source-status artifacts.
- Added `docs/asmsim-process-buffer-status.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused ASMSIM process-buffer source-status test passed 5
  tests, the adjacent command source-status suite passed 34 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 379 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new test, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests, and

- Added ADR-0064 after reviewing PRC's official TLA files as a possible formal
  source for blocked Universal Cell command semantics.
- Wrote `tests/test_official_tla_universal_cell_status.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `sources/official_tla_universal_cell_status.json` was absent.
- Added `sources/official_tla_universal_cell_status.json`, recording
  `universal-cell.tla` as a partial 45-line activation skeleton,
  `universalcell.tla` as a one-line stub, and `uc.tla` as empty.
- Cross-linked the evidence from the standard-signal, write-buffer, and stem
  command source-status artifacts.
- Added `docs/official-tla-universal-cell-status.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, PRC hardware witness notes, project
  memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused TLA/adjacent source-status suite passed 33 tests and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 384 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new test, JSON parsing passed for the touched source-status manifests, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Recipient Init Transition Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0065 to make one already implemented recipient init command-message
  transition inspectable as a single evidence path.
- Wrote `tests/test_recipient_init_transition_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle` was absent.
- Added `evidence/recipient_init_command_message_bundle.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/evidence_bundle.py`.
- The bundle ties `UC-RECIPIENT-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-PROCESSED` and its
  positive fixed-upstream `wire-r-init` example to the proof certificate,
  recipient init schematic trace, committed SVG render, PRC hardware witness
  map, and recipient/non-init/standard-signal/write-buffer source-status
  boundaries.
- Added `docs/recipient-init-transition-evidence-bundle.md` and updated
  README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, recipient command source
  status, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused bundle and recipient source-status tests passed 10
  tests, the adjacent evidence stack passed 47 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 389 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  new validator and touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the bundle and
  recipient source-status manifest, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-17 - Evidence Bundle Registry

- Added ADR-0066 to make transition evidence bundles discoverable and
  batch-verifiable.
- Wrote `tests/test_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because `load_evidence_bundle_registry` was absent from
  `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle`.
- Added `evidence/manifest.json` with the ADR-0065 recipient init evidence
  bundle as the first registered bundle.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/evidence_bundle.py` with registry dataclasses,
  loading, duplicate detection, missing-path detection, entry-to-bundle
  agreement checks, and whole-bundle validation.
- Added `docs/evidence-bundle-registry.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused registry/bundle tests passed 10 tests, the adjacent
  evidence stack passed 52 tests, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 394
  tests. `py_compile` passed for the touched evidence bundle module and tests,
  JSON parsing passed for the registry and bundle manifests, and

- Added ADR-0067 to expose evidence registry validation as a direct project
  command.
- Wrote `tests/test_evidence_bundle_cli.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `format_registry_validation_report` and the CLI runner were
  absent from `autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle`.
- Added `format_registry_validation_report`, `run_evidence_bundle_cli`, and a
  module entrypoint for
  `python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json`.
- The command prints `OK` or `FAIL` validation lines and returns exit code `0`
  only when every registry validation result is accepted.

  docs, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused CLI/registry tests passed 9 tests, the actual module
  command printed an all-`OK` report, the adjacent evidence stack passed 56
  tests, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 398 tests. `py_compile`
  passed for the touched module and tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry
  and registered bundle manifests, and `git diff --check` passed.

  and CLI now validate two bundles: the recipient init transition and the
  recipient non-init rejection boundary.
- Added `docs/recipient-non-init-evidence-bundle.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, evidence registry docs, recipient
  non-init source status, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused bundle/registry/CLI/source-status tests passed 20
  tests, the actual registry CLI printed an all-`OK` report for two bundles,
  the adjacent rejection/evidence stack passed 73 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 404 tests. `py_compile` passed for the

  tests, the actual registry CLI printed an all-`OK` report for three bundles,
  the adjacent multi-command/rejection/evidence stack passed 68 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 410 tests. `py_compile` passed for the
  touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry, new bundle, and touched
  source-status manifest, and `git diff --check` passed.

- Added ADR-0070 to make the evidence registry fail closed over sibling
  `*_bundle.json` files.
- Extended `tests/test_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because registry validation did not emit
  `registry-completeness` and did not reject an unregistered sibling bundle.
- Added `source_path` tracking to loaded evidence registries and a
  `registry-completeness` validation result that discovers sibling bundle
  files beside the manifest.
- Updated the CLI report path so
  `python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json`
  shows the completeness check.

  run failed because `registry_validation_report_payload` was absent.
- Added `registry_validation_report_payload` and `--format text|json` to the
  evidence registry CLI while preserving text as the default.
- The JSON payload records registry ID, overall accepted status, bundle count,
  result count, and per-subject validation results. Failure payloads keep the
  same non-zero exit behavior as text output.
- Updated README, roadmap, literature map, open problems, evidence registry
  docs, project memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused CLI tests passed 8 tests, both actual CLI text and JSON
  modes passed, the adjacent evidence stack passed 31 tests, and

  and CLI now validate four bundles: recipient init execution, recipient
  non-init rejection, multi-command rejection, and direct self-mailbox init.
- Aligned `schematics/self_mailbox_init_trace.json` and its generated SVG with
  the named claim example so the integrated validator checks one exact
  transition path.

  roadmap, literature map, open problems, evidence registry docs, stem command
  source status, project memory, and lessons.

  focused stack passed 48 tests, the adjacent self-mailbox/evidence stack
  passed 76 tests, both actual CLI text and JSON modes passed for four
  bundles, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 422 tests. `py_compile`
  passed for the touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry, new
  bundle, touched source status, and aligned trace.

## 2026-05-17 - Self-Mailbox Unsupported Evidence Bundle

  passed for the touched tests, JSON parsing passed for the registry, new
  bundle, touched source status, and aligned trace.

## 2026-05-17 - Self Command-Buffer Init Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0074 to register the completed self-target command-buffer init
  dispatch as the sixth transition evidence bundle.
- Wrote `tests/test_self_command_buffer_init_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `evidence/self_command_buffer_init_bundle.json` was absent.
- Added `evidence/self_command_buffer_init_bundle.json` for the positive
  `self command buffer processor left init` example under

  neighbor-delivery sender transition into recipient init-family command
  consumption.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.transition_chains` was absent.
- Added `autarkic_systems/transition_chains.py` with
  `execute_neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain`, which runs one stem sender step,
  installs the delivered output tuple as recipient upstream state only when

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Chain Claim

- Added ADR-0078 to promote the ADR-0077 two-step handoff into a named chain
  claim and proof-certificate surface without forcing it into the
  single-transition claim language.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_claim.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `autarkic_systems.chain_claims` was absent.
- Added `claims/transition_chain_claims.json` for
  `UC-CHAIN-NEIGHBOR-DELIVERY-RECIPIENT-CONSUMED`, with one positive
  `neighbor-b/proc-l-init` consumption example and three boundary examples.
- Added `claims/transition_chain_proof_certificates.json`,
  `autarkic_systems/transition_chain_predicates.py`, and
  `autarkic_systems/chain_claims.py` for manifest-example evaluation and
  certificate verification over transition-chain examples.

  predicates, `UC-CHAIN-` sentence prefixes, proof-object rules, and active
  chain claim/certificate manifest paths.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_object_language.py` to validate the chain
  language manifest and the current chain claim/certificate surface.
- Added `docs/transition-chain-claim-language.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, the chain-claim note, and the
  single-transition claim-language note.
- Verified the focused chain object-language test passed 5 tests, the adjacent
  chain-language/chain-claim/object-language stack passed 20 tests, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 464 tests. JSON parsing passed for the
  chain language manifest, `py_compile` passed for the new module and test,
  `git diff --check` passed, and the evidence registry JSON CLI still reported
  8 accepted bundles.

- Added ADR-0080 to expose transition-chain claim validation as an
  operator-facing command.
- Wrote `tests/test_transition_chain_claim_cli.py` before implementation. The
  red run failed because chain-claim CLI/report functions were absent from
  `autarkic_systems.chain_claims`.
- Added report dataclasses, `validate_transition_chain_claim_project`,
  text/JSON report formatting, and `run_chain_claim_cli` to
  `autarkic_systems/chain_claims.py`.
- The new command validates the chain language manifest, chain examples, chain
  proof certificates, and chain claim surface:
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_claims`.

  delivery recipient-consumption chain inspectable as one composed-chain
  evidence artifact.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle` was absent.
- Added `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_chain_bundle.json` so the chain
  bundle stays separate from the top-level single-transition evidence registry.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` to validate schema,
  executable chain example status, chain predicate acceptance, proof
  certificate coverage, chain language validity, the two underlying transition
  evidence bundles, source-status JSON, boundary terms, and text/JSON CLI
  output.
- Added `docs/neighbor-delivery-chain-evidence-bundle.md` and updated README,
  roadmap, literature map, open problems, chain-claim/language notes,
  evidence-registry note, memory, and lessons.

  `python -m unittest discover` passed 479 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Chain Trace

- Added ADR-0082 to record the ADR-0077 neighbor delivery
  recipient-consumption handoff as a dedicated transition-chain trace before
  adding any renderer.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_trace.py` before implementation
  and updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` to
  require the chain evidence bundle to validate the trace. The red run failed
  because `autarkic_systems.chain_trace` was absent, `chain_trace_path` was
  missing from the bundle model, and `chain-trace` was not yet a bundle
  validation subject.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain_trace.json`,
  recording the stem sender step, delivered `proc-l-init` tuple, recipient
  initial state, recipient handoff state, recipient init-consumption step, and
  chain boundaries.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_trace.py` to replay the sender step, verify
  the output-to-upstream handoff, replay the recipient step, and replay the
  full chain helper.
- Updated `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_chain_bundle.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` so the composed-chain evidence
  bundle validates the new trace.
- Added `docs/neighbor-delivery-chain-trace.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, recipient-chain, chain-claim, and
  chain-evidence notes, memory, and lessons.

- Added ADR-0083 to render the ADR-0082 transition-chain trace as a checked SVG
  artifact.
- Wrote `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_svg.py` before implementation and
  updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` to require
  the chain evidence bundle to validate the SVG. The red run failed because
  `autarkic_systems.chain_svg` was absent, `chain_svg_path` was missing from
  the bundle model, and `chain-svg` was not yet a bundle validation subject.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_svg.py` to render the two-cell sender/handoff/
  recipient view from the chain trace and validate XML metadata, exact renderer
  output, visible labels, and routed flows.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_recipient_chain_trace.svg` as the
  checked renderer output. The first green attempt caught and fixed a trailing
  blank-line drift in the committed SVG.
- Updated `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_chain_bundle.json` and
  `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` so the composed-chain evidence
  bundle validates the SVG.
- Added `docs/neighbor-delivery-chain-svg.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, chain trace, chain evidence, memory, and
  lessons.

  checked SVG, `jq` parsed the updated bundle, `py_compile` passed for the
  new/touched modules and tests, the chain evidence JSON CLI reported
  `accepted: true` with `result_count: 9` and an accepted `chain-svg` subject,
  the chain claims JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true`, the existing
  transition evidence registry JSON CLI still reported 8 accepted bundles,
  `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 492
  tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Evidence Registry

- Added ADR-0084 to make transition-chain evidence bundles discoverable and
  batch-validatable without merging them into the single-transition evidence
  registry.
- Wrote `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because the chain registry loader/report functions were
  absent from `autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle`.
- Added `evidence/chains/manifest.json`, registering the neighbor delivery
  recipient-chain evidence bundle.
- Extended `autarkic_systems/chain_evidence_bundle.py` with registry dataclasses,
  loader, validator, text report, JSON payload, and `--registry` CLI support
  while preserving the existing single-bundle default.
- Added `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md` and updated README, roadmap,
  literature map, open problems, chain evidence note, memory, and lessons.
- Verified the focused chain registry test passed 10 tests, adjacent
  registry/bundle tests passed 18 tests, the chain registry CLI passed in text
  and JSON modes with `accepted: true` and `bundle_count: 1`, the existing
  single-bundle chain evidence JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` and
  `result_count: 9`, the existing transition evidence registry JSON CLI still
  reported 8 accepted bundles, `jq` parsed the new registry, `py_compile`
  passed for the touched module and focused test, `git diff --check` passed,
  and `python -m unittest discover` passed 502 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Evidence CLI Target Selection

- Added ADR-0085 to make `--bundle` and `--registry` mutually exclusive for
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle`.
- Wrote `tests/test_chain_evidence_cli_target_selection.py` before
  implementation. The red run showed the parser accepted both flags and
  silently validated the registry.
- Updated `run_chain_evidence_bundle_cli` to put `--bundle` and `--registry`
  in an argparse mutually exclusive group while preserving the checked-in
  single-bundle default when neither flag is supplied.
- Updated `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md`, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the explicit target-selection rule.
- Verified the focused target-selection test passed 2 tests, adjacent chain
  CLI/registry/bundle tests passed 20 tests, the single-bundle chain evidence
  JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` with `result_count: 9`, the chain
  registry JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` with `bundle_count: 1`,
  `py_compile` passed for the touched module and focused test,
  `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed 504
  tests.

- Added ADR-0086 to make chain evidence registry JSON output list the concrete
  bundles validated in a run.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `chain_registry_validation_report_payload` did
  not include a `bundles` key.
- Extended `chain_registry_validation_report_payload` so registry JSON includes
  each registered bundle ID, path, chain claim ID, and expected status.
- Updated `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md`, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the JSON payload contract.
- Verified the focused chain registry test passed 10 tests, adjacent chain
  CLI/registry/bundle tests passed 20 tests, chain registry JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 1`, and the expected `bundles` entry, the
  single-bundle chain evidence JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` and
  `result_count: 9`, `py_compile` passed for the touched module and focused
  test, `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed
  504 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Registry JSON Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0087 to make failed chain evidence registry JSON output summarize
  rejected validation subjects directly.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because `chain_registry_validation_report_payload` did
  not include `failed_subjects`.
- Added `failed_subjects` to chain registry JSON output. Successful registry
  runs report an empty list; drifted registries report the rejected validation
  subjects in result order.
- The first green attempt showed that a drifted in-place registry correctly
  fails both missing-path validation and closed-index completeness, so the test
  expectation now preserves that signal.
- Updated `docs/chain-evidence-bundle-registry.md`, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the failure-summary contract.
- Verified the focused chain registry test passed 12 tests, adjacent chain
  CLI/registry/bundle tests passed 22 tests, chain registry JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 1`, and `failed_subjects: []`, the
  single-bundle chain evidence JSON CLI still reported `accepted: true` and
  `result_count: 9`, `py_compile` passed for the touched module and focused
  test, `git diff --check` passed, and `python -m unittest discover` passed
  506 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Bundle JSON Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0088 to make single-bundle chain evidence JSON output summarize
  rejected validation subjects directly.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_evidence_bundle.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because `chain_evidence_bundle_report_payload`
  did not include `failed_subjects`.
- Added `failed_subjects` to chain bundle JSON output. Successful bundle runs
  report an empty list; a drifted expected chain status reports
  `chain-claim-example` and `chain-trace`.
- Updated the chain evidence bundle note, chain registry note, roadmap, memory,
  and lessons with the parallel bundle/registry failure-summary contract.
- Focused verification passed 10 bundle tests; adjacent chain bundle, registry,
  and CLI target-selection verification passed 24 tests. Bundle JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `result_count: 9`, and `failed_subjects: []`; registry JSON
  reported `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 1`, and `failed_subjects: []`.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and the full default suite passed, with
  `python -m unittest discover` running 508 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Vertical Chain Demo Report

- Added ADR-0089 to make the current transition-chain work visible as one
  operator-facing claim-to-evidence report.
- Wrote `tests/test_chain_demo_report.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because `autarkic_systems.chain_demo` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/chain_demo.py`, reusing the existing chain evidence
  validator and formatting the bundle, claim, predicate, positive example,
  chain function, expected status, validation summary, trace, SVG, lower-level
  transition bundles, source-status files, and boundary terms as text or JSON.
- Updated README, the chain evidence bundle note, open problems, roadmap,
  memory, lessons, and the dedicated vertical demo report note.
- Verified the focused demo test passed 6 tests; adjacent demo, chain bundle,
  chain registry, and CLI target-selection tests passed 30 tests. The text CLI
  printed the full claim-to-evidence path, JSON CLI reported `accepted: true`,
  `validation.result_count: 9`, and `validation.failed_subjects: []`,
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed 514 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Demo Artifact Presence

- Added ADR-0090 to make the vertical chain demo explicit about whether each
  listed evidence artifact exists.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_demo_report.py` before implementation. The red run
  failed because demo evidence layers lacked `exists`, the payload lacked
  `missing_evidence_paths`, and text output did not summarize missing paths.
- Extended `autarkic_systems.chain_demo` so every evidence layer reports
  `exists`, the payload exposes `missing_evidence_paths`, and text output
  prints `Missing evidence paths: none` for the checked-in bundle.
- Updated README, the vertical demo note, the chain evidence bundle note, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the artifact-presence contract.
- Verified the focused demo test passed 7 tests; adjacent demo, chain bundle,
  chain registry, and CLI target-selection tests passed 31 tests. Text demo
  output reported `Missing evidence paths: none`; JSON demo output reported
  `missing_evidence_paths: []` and `exists: true` for every evidence layer.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 515 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain Claim

- Added ADR-0091 to promote the delivered non-init recipient rejection
  boundary into its own transition-chain claim.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_claim.py` and
  `tests/test_transition_chain_claim_cli.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `neighbor_delivery_rejected_by_recipient` did not exist.
- Added `neighbor_delivery_rejected_by_recipient`, the
  `UC-CHAIN-NEIGHBOR-DELIVERY-RECIPIENT-REJECTED` manifest claim, its
  manifest-example proof certificate, and the language predicate symbol.
- Updated the chain claim docs, transition-chain language docs, README, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the second chain claim.
- Verified the focused chain claim test passed 8 tests; adjacent chain claim,
  object-language, and CLI tests passed 20 tests; adjacent chain evidence,
  registry, and demo tests passed 29 tests. Chain claim JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `claim_count: 2`, `certificate_count: 2`, and
  `chain-examples: evaluated 7 examples`; chain evidence JSON remained
  accepted with `result_count: 9` and `failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 518 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain Trace

- Added ADR-0092 to record the delivered non-init recipient rejection boundary
  as a composed-chain trace before SVG or evidence-bundle promotion.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_trace.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because
  `NEIGHBOR_DELIVERY_REJECTION_CHAIN_TRACE_ARTIFACT_ID` did not exist.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_trace.json` for
  the `neighbor-c/write-buf-one` delivery, handoff, recipient rejection, and
  `recipient-not-consumed` chain status.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.chain_trace` so trace validation can accept an
  expected rejection status when replayed status and cells match the artifact.
- Updated README, the chain trace note, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the rejection-trace layer.
- Verified the focused chain trace test passed 11 tests; adjacent trace,
  claim, object-language, and CLI tests passed 31 tests; adjacent evidence,
  registry, and demo tests passed 29 tests. Chain evidence JSON remained
  accepted with `result_count: 9` and `failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 522 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain SVG

- Added ADR-0093 to render the delivered non-init recipient rejection chain
  trace as a checked SVG artifact.
- Updated `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_chain_svg.py` before implementation.
  The red run failed because
  `NEIGHBOR_DELIVERY_REJECTION_CHAIN_SVG_ARTIFACT` did not exist.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.chain_svg` so the handoff label derives its channel
  index from the delivered tuple instead of hard-coding channel 1.
- Added `schematics/chains/neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_trace.svg`,
  showing `recipient-not-consumed`, `sender output[2] -> recipient upstream[2]`,
  delivered tuple `[_, _, write-buf-one]`, and recipient `rejected-input`.
- Updated README, the chain SVG note, the chain trace note, open problems,
  roadmap, memory, and lessons with the rejection SVG layer.
- Verified the focused SVG test passed 9 tests; adjacent SVG, trace, and
  evidence tests passed 30 tests; adjacent registry and demo tests passed 19
  tests. Chain evidence JSON remained accepted with `result_count: 9` and
  `failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and
  `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full suite running 525 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Neighbor Delivery Rejection Chain Evidence Bundle

- Added ADR-0094 to give the delivered non-init recipient rejection chain an
  integrated evidence bundle and registry coverage.
- Added `tests/test_neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_evidence_bundle.py` and
  updated `tests/test_chain_evidence_bundle_registry.py` before
  implementation. The red run failed because the rejection bundle file and
  registry entry were missing.
- Added `evidence/chains/neighbor_delivery_rejection_chain_bundle.json`,
  linking the rejection chain claim, proof certificate, language, trace, SVG,
  neighbor-delivery transition bundle, recipient non-init rejection transition
  bundle, and source-status records.
- Registered the rejection bundle in `evidence/chains/manifest.json`, bringing
  the chain evidence registry to two bundles.
- Updated README, chain evidence bundle docs, chain registry docs, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, and lessons with the rejection bundle.
- Verified focused rejection bundle and registry tests passed 17 tests; the
  adjacent chain evidence bundle, rejection bundle, registry, and CLI
  target-selection tests passed 29 tests. Rejection bundle JSON reported
  `accepted: true`, `result_count: 9`, and `failed_subjects: []`; registry JSON
  reported `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 2`, and `failed_subjects: []`.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 530 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Chain Demo Registry Report

- Added ADR-0095 to expose the whole transition-chain evidence registry through
  the vertical chain demo report.
- Updated `tests/test_chain_demo_report.py` before implementation. The first
  red run failed because `build_chain_demo_registry_report` was missing. A
  second red test then caught missing registered bundle paths raising
  `FileNotFoundError` instead of returning a structured rejected report.
- Extended `autarkic_systems.chain_demo` with `--registry` mode, registry
  validation, per-bundle demo report summaries, accepted/failed bundle counts,
  missing-path summaries, and argparse rejection for ambiguous `--bundle` plus
  `--registry` target selection.
- Updated README, chain registry docs, chain evidence bundle docs, open
  problems, roadmap, memory, lessons, and the vertical demo report note with
  the registry demo command and failure-reporting contract.
- Verified the focused demo report test passed 13 tests; adjacent demo,
  registry, consumed-bundle, and rejection-bundle tests passed 40 tests. Demo
  registry JSON reported `accepted: true`, `bundle_count: 2`,
  `accepted_count: 2`, `failed_count: 0`, and `missing_evidence_paths: []`.
  Demo registry text named both registered chain bundles. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 536 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Project Status Report

- Added ADR-0096 to make the current evidence state and blocked command-token
  frontier visible from one command.
- Added `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because `autarkic_systems.project_status` did not exist.
- Added `autarkic_systems/project_status.py`, which reuses the transition
  evidence registry validator, the chain evidence registry validator, and the
  current recipient non-init, `standard-signal`, and write-buffer source-status
  JSON files.
- The status report now emits text and JSON, reports 8 accepted transition
  evidence bundles and 2 accepted chain evidence bundles on the checked-in
  path, names `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one` as the
  blocked command-token frontier, and returns structured failure output for
  missing source-status files.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the new status command.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 5 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, chain registry, and chain demo tests passed 43
  tests. Text CLI reported accepted status, both bundle counts, the blocked
  command list, and no missing source-status files. JSON CLI reported
  `accepted: true`, transition `bundle_count: 8`, chain `bundle_count: 2`, and
  the same blocked command list. `py_compile` passed for the touched module and
  focused test. `git diff --check` and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 541 tests.

## 2026-05-17 - Project Status Registry Failures

- Added ADR-0097 to make project-status registry path failures structured
  report output instead of tracebacks.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed in four missing-registry cases with `FileNotFoundError` for the
  transition and chain registry loaders.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so transition and chain registry
  loading are summarized independently. Missing registries now report
  `failed_subjects: ["registry-file"]`, `bundle_count: 0`, the requested path,
  and a failed `registry-file` result while preserving the other readable
  status sections.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the structured registry-failure contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 9 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 34 tests. A
  missing transition registry JSON run exited `1` and reported
  `transition_evidence.failed_subjects: ["registry-file"]`; a missing chain
  registry text run exited `1` and named the missing registry path. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and no missing source-status files. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 545 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Invalid Registries

- Added ADR-0098 to distinguish malformed registry files from missing registry
  files in the project status report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed because invalid transition and chain registries still reported
  `failed_subjects: ["registry-file"]`, and text output listed them under
  missing registry files.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so missing registry paths keep
  `registry-file`, while existing registry files with JSON/schema/load errors
  report `registry-json`. Text output now names invalid registry files
  separately.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the refined failure contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 12 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 37 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and no missing or invalid source-status files.
  `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed,
  with the full suite running 548 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Frontier Failure Summary

- Added ADR-0099 to give the project status frontier section a compact
  `failed_subjects` summary.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run failed in five accepted, missing, invalid, and mixed source-status cases
  because `frontier.failed_subjects` was absent.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so frontier output reports an empty
  failure-subject list on the checked-in path, `source-status-file` for missing
  source-status files, `source-status-json` for malformed source-status files,
  and both subjects in stable order when both failure modes occur.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the frontier failure-summary contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 14 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 39 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 550 tests.

## 2026-05-18 - Project Status Source Status Shape

- Added ADR-0100 to reject source-status JSON that parses but lacks the minimal
  shape needed by the project status frontier report.
- Updated `tests/test_project_status_report.py` before implementation. The red
  run showed `{}` was silently accepted as an empty frontier, while `[]`
  crashed with `AttributeError` because the report tried to call `.get` on a
  list.
- Updated `autarkic_systems.project_status` so source-status inputs must be
  JSON objects with non-empty text `decision` and `safe_next_slice` fields.
  Shape failures now report `source-status-schema`, while JSON parse failures
  keep reporting `source-status-json`.
- Updated README, project-status docs, open problems, roadmap, memory, and
  lessons with the source-status shape contract.
- Verified the focused project status test passed 16 tests; adjacent project
  status, transition registry, and chain registry tests passed 41 tests. The
  checked-in JSON status remained accepted with transition `bundle_count: 8`,
  chain `bundle_count: 2`, and `frontier.failed_subjects: []`. `py_compile`,
  `git diff --check`, and `python -m unittest discover` passed, with the full
  suite running 552 tests.
