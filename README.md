# Autarkic Systems

Autarkic Systems is the umbrella project for turning the Autarkic Formal
Systems research program into an organized theory and, where the theory is
ready, executable or simulable artifacts.

The lower-bound objective is an artificial entity that demonstrates cognitive
sovereignty: it should be able to reason about itself, its knowledge, and its
computational substrate without depending on opaque external authority as the
final source of confidence.

  summary, and validation result.

  emits the transition-chain evidence registry validation report as
  machine-readable JSON.

  demo report in text form; `--registry evidence/chains/manifest.json` emits
  one report over every registered chain bundle, and `--format json` emits the
  same claim-to-evidence surfaces for automation, including artifact presence
  and missing-path summaries.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.project_status --format json` emits the current
  project status as schema-versioned machine-readable JSON: transition
  evidence accepted with 8 bundles, chain evidence accepted with 2 bundles,
  and the blocked `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one`
  command-token frontier. Schema version `2` also attributes those commands to
  each accepted source-status entry. Missing registries report
  `registry-file`, malformed registries report `registry-json`, and
  source-status path problems are summarized in `frontier.failed_subjects` as
  `source-status-file`, `source-status-json`, or `source-status-schema`;
  source-status records must also expose at least one blocked command token
  through `command`, `commands`, or `blocked_runtime_commands`, and blank
  command-token strings are rejected as schema failures.

## Fast Verification

```sh
python -m unittest discover
```

The current executable probes live in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` and
`autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`, with claim-manifest,
proof-certificate, and object-language support in
`autarkic_systems/claim_manifest.py`, `autarkic_systems/proof_certificates.py`,
`autarkic_systems/object_language.py`, and
`autarkic_systems/willard_map.py`. Source-backed structured maps also live in
`autarkic_systems/prc_hardware_map.py` and
`autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py`, with schematic-linked trace support in
`autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` and generated SVG support in
`autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py`. They are covered by `tests/`.

## Subordinate Programs

Autarkic Systems currently subsumes three named programs:

- Autarkic Formal Systems (`jpt4/afs`): the immediate formal-systems layer.
  At the reviewed snapshot it is only a placeholder README, so this repository
  must supply the first serious integration structure.
- Pervasively Reconfigurable Computing (`jpt4/prc`): the embodied computing
  substrate. It studies Universal Cells, geometrically explicit logic circuits,
  reversible logic elements with memory, explicit routing, and physically
  grounded reconfiguration.
- Self-Justifying Axiom Systems (`jpt4/sjas`): the formal-confidence substrate.
  It studies Willard-style self-justifying axiom systems, self-provability of
  consistency under tuned expressivity, and executable fragments in Racket,
  Clojure/core.logic, and Proflog-adjacent work.

## Development Discipline

Follow `AGENTS.md` before changing this repository. In brief:

- ADRs precede feature implementation.
- Tests precede code when code is added.
- Documentation belongs in the right layer: `LOG.md` for chronology,
  `MEMORY.md` for high-priority future context, `LESSONS.md` for durable
  lessons, and README files for current entrypoints.
- Branches should follow the ADR structure of the work.

The default branch is currently `main`, even though `AGENTS.md` refers to
`master` in its generic branch-discipline text. Until the repository owner
changes the remote default branch, use `main` as the integration branch while
preserving the ADR-shaped branch flow.
