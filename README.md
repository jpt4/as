# Autarkic Systems

Autarkic Systems is the umbrella project for turning the Autarkic Formal
Systems research program into an organized theory and, where the theory is
ready, executable or simulable artifacts.

The lower-bound objective is an artificial entity that demonstrates cognitive
sovereignty: it should be able to reason about itself, its knowledge, and its
computational substrate without depending on opaque external authority as the
final source of confidence.

## Current Repository State

This repository has moved from its initial scaffolding stage into a narrow
executable evidence stack. The initial upstream commit contained only
`AGENTS.md` and its backup, so the first durable work made the project
legible; current work now layers checked Universal Cell transitions, claims,
proof certificates, object languages, evidence bundles, and status reports:

- `step_stem_cell` processes the self-mailbox init-family commands while
  leaving full command-buffer execution open.
- `step_stem_cell` also dispatches a just-completed self-target init-family

  transition-chain evidence bundle and exposes
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle` for direct text/JSON
  validation of one bundle or a chain registry.
- `autarkic_systems/chain_demo.py` renders vertical chain demo reports,
  reusing the chain evidence validator while summarizing one bundle or every
  registered chain bundle with its claim, executable chain, trace, SVG,
  lower-level evidence bundles, source-status boundaries, artifact-presence
  summary, and validation result.
- `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` renders one operator-facing report over
  the transition evidence registry, chain evidence registry, base
  claim/proof/language surfaces, transition-chain claim/language surfaces, and
  the live source-status frontier for blocked command-token semantics and
  their resolution-question IDs.
- `claims/transition_claims.json` names the current executable transition
  claims and examples, including the self-mailbox init-command execution
  subset, unsupported-command preservation boundary, self-target command-buffer
  init dispatch, neighbor-target command-buffer delivery, recipient
  init-family command-message consumption, recipient non-init command-message
  rejection, and the self-target non-init completed-buffer append boundary.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.claim_manifest` validates those transition claim
  examples in text or JSON form.
- `claims/proof_certificates.json` adds the first tiny proof certificates over
  those transition claims, including `manifest-example` steps and the first
  `predicate-result` steps that name the evaluated predicate directly.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.proof_certificates` validates the transition
  proof-certificate surface in text or JSON form.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.object_language` validates the transition claim
  language manifest and the checked claim/proof surface in text or JSON form.
- `claims/transition_chain_claims.json` names the executable two-step
  transition-chain claims for consumed init delivery and rejected non-init
  delivery.
- `claims/transition_chain_proof_certificates.json` adds matching
  manifest-example proof certificates for those chain claims.
- `language/transition_chain_claim_language.json` names the first explicit
  syntax classes for transition-chain claims.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_claims --format json` emits the
  transition-chain claim validation report as machine-readable JSON.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle --format json` emits the
  neighbor-delivery chain evidence-bundle validation report as
  machine-readable JSON.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle --registry evidence/chains/manifest.json --format json`
  emits the transition-chain evidence registry validation report as
  machine-readable JSON.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_demo` emits the default transition-chain
  demo report in text form; `--registry evidence/chains/manifest.json` emits
  one report over every registered chain bundle, and `--format json` emits the
  same claim-to-evidence surfaces for automation, including artifact presence
  and missing-path summaries.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.project_status --format json` emits the current
  project status as schema-versioned machine-readable JSON: transition
  evidence accepted with 8 bundles, chain evidence accepted with 2 bundles,
  transition claim examples accepted with 13 claims and 35 matched examples,
  transition proof certificates accepted with 13 claims and 13 certificates,
  transition-chain claims accepted with 2 claims and 2 certificates,
  transition language accepted with 13 claims and 13 certificates, chain
  language accepted with 2 claims and 2 certificates, concrete transition and
  chain registry bundle entries, and the blocked
  `standard-signal`, `write-buf-zero`, and `write-buf-one` command-token
  frontier. The default text report also names the concrete transition and
  chain evidence bundle IDs and paths, transition bundle positive and covered
  examples, claim/proof and language failed subjects when present, the
  standard-signal and write-buffer blocked runtime surfaces, source-status AS
  boundaries, execution-readiness gates, the resolution-question IDs and
  summaries that define the next source-backed decision work, the source
  evidence explaining why unresolved questions remain blocked, resolved
  question decisions that should not be reopened without new evidence, and the
  source-status cross-links behind the blocked frontier. Schema version `2`
  attributes
  blocked commands to each
  accepted source-status entry, schema version `3` carries the source-status
  resolution-question IDs that still block command-token execution and rejects
  malformed resolution-question metadata, schema version `4` adds
  summary-bearing `resolution_questions` objects, schema version `5` adds
  checked `blocked_runtime_surfaces` lists, and schema version `6` adds
  registry `bundles` arrays to the transition and chain evidence summaries.
  Schema version `7` adds `positive_example` and
  `covered_positive_examples` to transition evidence bundle entries; the
  default text report renders those fields when present. Schema version `8`
  adds `additional_source_statuses` cross-links to accepted source-status
  entries so automation can inspect the source-review trail behind the
  blocked frontier; the default text report renders those cross-links when
  present. Schema version `9` adds `resolved_resolution_questions` to accepted
  source-status entries and renders a `Resolved resolution questions:` text
  section. Schema version `10` carries optional resolved-question detail fields
  such as formal command offset and legacy divergence into JSON/text. Schema
  version `11` adds transition and chain language summaries to JSON/text.
  Schema version `12` adds base transition claim and proof-certificate
  summaries to JSON/text. Schema version `13` adds the transition-chain claim
  summary to JSON/text. Schema version `14` adds
  `resolution_question_evidence` to accepted source-status entries and renders
  a `Resolution question evidence:` text section. Schema version `15` adds
  `execution_readiness` gates to accepted source-status entries and renders an
  `Execution readiness:` text section.
  Missing registries report
  `registry-file`, malformed registries report `registry-json`, and
  source-status path problems are summarized in `frontier.failed_subjects` as
  `source-status-file`, `source-status-json`, or `source-status-schema`;
  source-status records must also expose at least one blocked command token
  through `command`, `commands`, or `blocked_runtime_commands`, and blank
  command-token strings are rejected as schema failures. Source-status
  `decision` and `safe_next_slice` text must also be non-whitespace, and
  recognized command-token fields, source-status cross-links, and resolved
  question source paths must have the expected text/list/object shapes.
  Source-status `resolution_question_evidence` IDs must match unresolved
  `required_resolution_questions` IDs in the same source-status record.
  When a source-status record has unresolved `required_resolution_questions`,
  `resolution_question_evidence` must cover every unresolved question ID.
  Unresolved and resolved source-status question IDs must each be unique inside
  a single source-status record, so set-based coverage checks cannot hide
  duplicate blockers or duplicate settled decisions.
  When a source-status record declares `execution_readiness.decision` as
  `blocked`, its `blocked_by_resolution_questions` list must also cover every
  unresolved question ID. A source-status record also cannot set
  `execution_change_allowed` to `true` while unresolved
  `required_resolution_questions` remain, or while `execution_readiness.decision`
  is `blocked`.
  Source-status cross-link paths and resolved question source paths must also
  point to existing files that contain JSON objects.
  Accepted source-status records must also provide non-empty top-level
  `as_boundary` text so the JSON frontier explains the AS boundary it is
  enforcing.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.source_status --format json` emits a focused
  source-status frontier report as schema-versioned machine-readable JSON:
  accepted/rejected state, failed subjects, blocked command tokens,
  per-source decisions, blocked runtime surfaces, AS boundaries, unresolved
  questions, source evidence for those questions, resolved decisions,
  execution-readiness gates, source-status cross-links, missing/invalid
  source-status paths, and the safe next slice. The shared validator rejects
  frontier records whose question IDs are simultaneously unresolved and
  resolved, and rejects execution-readiness blockers that do not match live
  unresolved questions or only partially cover them. It also rejects readiness
  records that allow execution changes while unresolved questions remain or
  while the readiness decision is `blocked`. Text mode renders the same
  frontier for operator diagnosis.

The current executable probes live in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` and
`autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`, with claim-manifest,
proof-certificate, and object-language support in
`autarkic_systems/claim_manifest.py`, `autarkic_systems/proof_certificates.py`,
`autarkic_systems/object_language.py`, and
`autarkic_systems/willard_map.py`. Source-backed structured maps also live in
`autarkic_systems/prc_hardware_map.py` and
`autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py`, with schematic-linked trace support in
`autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` and generated SVG support in
`autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py`. They are covered by `tests/`.

## Subordinate Programs

Autarkic Systems currently subsumes three named programs:

- Autarkic Formal Systems (`jpt4/afs`): the immediate formal-systems layer.
  At the reviewed snapshot it is only a placeholder README, so this repository
  must supply the first serious integration structure.
- Pervasively Reconfigurable Computing (`jpt4/prc`): the embodied computing
  substrate. It studies Universal Cells, geometrically explicit logic circuits,
  reversible logic elements with memory, explicit routing, and physically
  grounded reconfiguration.
- Self-Justifying Axiom Systems (`jpt4/sjas`): the formal-confidence substrate.
  It studies Willard-style self-justifying axiom systems, self-provability of
  consistency under tuned expressivity, and executable fragments in Racket,
  Clojure/core.logic, and Proflog-adjacent work.

## Development Discipline

Follow `AGENTS.md` before changing this repository. In brief:

- ADRs precede feature implementation.
- Tests precede code when code is added.
- Documentation belongs in the right layer: `LOG.md` for chronology,
  `MEMORY.md` for high-priority future context, `LESSONS.md` for durable
  lessons, and README files for current entrypoints.
- Branches should follow the ADR structure of the work.

The default branch is currently `main`, even though `AGENTS.md` refers to
`master` in its generic branch-discipline text. Until the repository owner
changes the remote default branch, use `main` as the integration branch while
preserving the ADR-shaped branch flow.
