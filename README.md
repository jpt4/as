# Autarkic Systems

Autarkic Systems is the umbrella project for turning the Autarkic Formal
Systems research program into an organized theory and, where the theory is
ready, executable or simulable artifacts.

The lower-bound objective is an artificial entity that demonstrates cognitive
sovereignty: it should be able to reason about itself, its knowledge, and its
computational substrate without depending on opaque external authority as the
final source of confidence.

## Current Repository State

This repository is at its first scaffolding stage. The initial upstream commit
contains only `AGENTS.md` and its backup, so the first durable work is to make
the project legible:

- `docs/project-charter.md` defines the umbrella project, key terms, and
  near-term research obligations.
- `docs/subordinate-review.md` records the first review of the referenced
  subordinate repositories.
- `docs/glossary.md` defines working project vocabulary.
- `docs/afs-requirements.md` defines the first requirement matrix for
  Autarkic Formal Systems.
- `docs/source-manifest.md` explains the pinned source manifest in
  `sources/manifest.json`.
- `docs/literature-map.md` and `docs/open-problems.md` connect reviewed
  sources to AS claims and next ADRs.
- `docs/roadmap.md` maps the first sequence of ADR-scoped work.
- `docs/adr/` holds Architecture Decision Records and their after-action
  follow-ups.
- `LOG.md` is the chronological development spine.
- `MEMORY.md` preserves the few facts that should remain present in future
  working context.
- `LESSONS.md` records durable lessons learned while working this project.

## Fast Verification

```sh
python -m unittest discover
```

The current executable probes live in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` and
`autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`, covered by `tests/`.

## Subordinate Programs

Autarkic Systems currently subsumes three named programs:

- Autarkic Formal Systems (`jpt4/afs`): the immediate formal-systems layer.
  At the reviewed snapshot it is only a placeholder README, so this repository
  must supply the first serious integration structure.
- Pervasively Reconfigurable Computing (`jpt4/prc`): the embodied computing
  substrate. It studies Universal Cells, geometrically explicit logic circuits,
  reversible logic elements with memory, explicit routing, and physically
  grounded reconfiguration.
- Self-Justifying Axiom Systems (`jpt4/sjas`): the formal-confidence substrate.
  It studies Willard-style self-justifying axiom systems, self-provability of
  consistency under tuned expressivity, and executable fragments in Racket,
  Clojure/core.logic, and Proflog-adjacent work.

## Development Discipline

Follow `AGENTS.md` before changing this repository. In brief:

- ADRs precede feature implementation.
- Tests precede code when code is added.
- Documentation belongs in the right layer: `LOG.md` for chronology,
  `MEMORY.md` for high-priority future context, `LESSONS.md` for durable
  lessons, and README files for current entrypoints.
- Branches should follow the ADR structure of the work.

The default branch is currently `main`, even though `AGENTS.md` refers to
`master` in its generic branch-discipline text. Until the repository owner
changes the remote default branch, use `main` as the integration branch while
preserving the ADR-shaped branch flow.
