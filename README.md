# Autarkic Systems

Autarkic Systems is the umbrella project for turning the Autarkic Formal
Systems research program into an organized theory and, where the theory is
ready, executable or simulable artifacts.

The lower-bound objective is an artificial entity that demonstrates cognitive
sovereignty: it should be able to reason about itself, its knowledge, and its
computational substrate without depending on opaque external authority as the
final source of confidence.

## Current Repository State

This repository has moved from its initial scaffolding stage into a narrow
executable evidence stack. The initial upstream commit contained only
`AGENTS.md` and its backup, so the first durable work made the project
legible; current work now layers checked Universal Cell transitions, claims,
proof certificates, object languages, evidence bundles, and status reports:

  the ADR-0170 recipient write-buffer command-message evidence bundle.
- `autarkic_systems/transition_chains.py` composes one neighbor delivery step

  post-handoff sequence trace artifact, replaying the accepted delivery and

  transition-chain evidence bundle and exposes
  `python -m autarkic_systems.chain_evidence_bundle` for direct text/JSON
  validation of one bundle or a chain registry.
- `autarkic_systems/chain_demo.py` renders vertical chain demo reports,
  reusing the chain evidence validator while summarizing one bundle or every
  registered chain bundle with its claim, executable chain, trace, SVG,
  lower-level evidence bundles, source-status boundaries, artifact-presence
  summary, and validation result.
- `autarkic_systems/project_status.py` renders one operator-facing report over
  the transition evidence registry, chain evidence registry, network-sequence
  evidence registry, base claim/proof/language surfaces, transition-chain

  and live source-status frontier for blocked command-token semantics and their
  resolution-question IDs.
- `autarkic_systems/vertical_demo.py` renders a first-run vertical demo digest
  over the accepted stack: current demonstration, evidence counts,
  claim/proof counts, proof-rule mix, formal-confidence validation summary,
  blocked command frontier, canonical registries, the checked network-sequence
  evidence bundle, and the concrete evidence trail from claim/proof/language
  artifacts through witness, trace, SVG, underlying chain bundle, and
  source-status records. It also surfaces the exact reproduction commands for
  the vertical demo, focused
  network-sequence JSON, compact project status, and refreshed handoff.
- `autarkic_systems/github_submission.py` renders local git evidence for the
  current GitHub submission path: current branch, `HEAD`, origin/fork remote
  URLs, origin/fork `main` match states, origin `main` divergence, and the
  upstream tracking issue. It prefers `submitted-to-origin` when source
  `origin/main` matches `HEAD`, while preserving `submitted-to-fork` as a
  fallback. It also renders a direct fork commit URL for the submitted `HEAD`,
  a fork `main` browser URL, a fork-hosted compare URL from `origin/main` to
  `HEAD`, an origin `main` browser URL, and remote-tracking ref freshness for
  both inspected `fork/main` and `origin/main` refs, normalizing common HTTPS
  and SSH GitHub remotes to web URLs.

  demo digest, and local GitHub submission status into one end-of-month
  handoff report.

  transition claim examples accepted with 16 claims and 40 matched examples,
  transition proof certificates accepted with 16 claims and 16 certificates,
  transition-chain claims accepted with 2 claims, 9 examples, and 2
  certificates, network-sequence claims accepted with 1 claim and 1
  certificate, a proof-rule audit showing 52 checked `predicate-result` steps
  and 0 checked `manifest-example` steps,
  formal-confidence targets accepted with 1 blocked target,
  transition language accepted with 16 claims and 16 certificates, chain
  language accepted with 2 claims and 2 certificates, network-sequence language
  accepted with 1 claim and 1 certificate, concrete transition, chain, and
  network-sequence registry bundle entries, sequence evidence bundle failed
  subjects when present, and the current blocked
  `standard-signal`
  command-token frontier. The default text report also names the concrete
  transition, chain, and network-sequence evidence bundle IDs and paths,
  transition bundle positive and covered examples, claim/proof and language
  failed subjects when present, the
  standard-signal blocked runtime surfaces, source-status AS boundaries,
  execution-readiness gates, the resolution-question IDs and
  summaries that define the next source-backed decision work, the source
  evidence explaining why unresolved questions remain blocked, resolved
  question decisions that should not be reopened without new evidence, latest
  source-review gates for records that name one, and the source-status
  cross-links behind the blocked frontier. Schema version `2`
  attributes
  blocked commands to each
  accepted source-status entry, schema version `3` carries the source-status
  resolution-question IDs that still block command-token execution and rejects
  malformed resolution-question metadata, schema version `4` adds
  summary-bearing `resolution_questions` objects, schema version `5` adds
  checked `blocked_runtime_surfaces` lists, and schema version `6` adds
  registry `bundles` arrays to the transition and chain evidence summaries.
  Schema version `7` adds `positive_example` and
  `covered_positive_examples` to transition evidence bundle entries; the
  default text report renders those fields when present. Schema version `8`
  adds `additional_source_statuses` cross-links to accepted source-status
  entries so automation can inspect the source-review trail behind the
  blocked frontier; the default text report renders those cross-links when
  present. Schema version `9` adds `resolved_resolution_questions` to accepted
  source-status entries and renders a `Resolved resolution questions:` text
  section. Schema version `10` carries optional resolved-question detail fields
  such as formal command offset and legacy divergence into JSON/text. Schema
  version `11` adds transition and chain language summaries to JSON/text.
  Schema version `12` adds base transition claim and proof-certificate
  summaries to JSON/text. Schema version `13` adds the transition-chain claim
  summary to JSON/text. Schema version `14` adds
  `resolution_question_evidence` to accepted source-status entries and renders
  a `Resolution question evidence:` text section. Schema version `15` adds
  `execution_readiness` gates to accepted source-status entries and renders an
  `Execution readiness:` text section. Completed safe-next items whose
  source-status strings begin with `no-` are treated as guards rather than
  active aggregate next slices, so the current report renders `Safe next
  slice: none` while `standard-signal` remains blocked. Schema version `16`
  adds the proof-rule audit to JSON/text so the checked transition and chain
  proof-certificate rule mix is visible from project status. The summary output
  format preserves schema version `16` while rendering the same payload as a
  compact operator digest. Schema version `17` adds `sequence_evidence` from
  the network-sequence evidence registry, includes it in aggregate acceptance,
  renders it in text and summary output, and adds `--sequence-registry`.
  Schema version `18` adds `sequence_claims` from the network-sequence
  claim/proof surface, includes sequence certificates in the proof-rule audit,
  renders sequence claim counts in text and summary output, and adds
  `--sequence-claims` / `--sequence-certificates`.
  Schema version `19` adds `sequence_language` from the network-sequence
  object-language surface, includes it in aggregate acceptance, renders it in
  text output, and adds `--sequence-language`. Schema version `20` adds
  `sequence_evidence.bundle_failed_subjects`, preserving inner
  network-sequence evidence bundle failure subjects such as `sequence-trace`
  or `sequence-svg` when a registry bundle rejects. Schema version `21` adds
  `latest_source_review` to accepted source-status frontier entries, validates
  the linked review artifact, and renders a `Latest source reviews:` text
  section. Schema version `22` adds `formal_confidence` from the checked
  formal-confidence target manifest, includes it in aggregate acceptance,
  renders formal-confidence status and failures in text and summary output,
  and adds `--formal-confidence-targets` / `--willard-map`.
  Schema version `23` adds a top-level `formal_confidence_validation` JSON
  summary derived from `formal_confidence.results`, exposing accepted/failed
  validation counts plus accepted frontier subjects and compact labels for
  automation without changing the nested formal-confidence payload.
  Missing registries report
  `registry-file`, malformed registries report `registry-json`, and
  source-status path problems are summarized in `frontier.failed_subjects` as
  `source-status-file`, `source-status-json`, or `source-status-schema`;
  source-status records must also expose at least one blocked command token
  through `command`, `commands`, or `blocked_runtime_commands`, and blank
  command-token strings are rejected as schema failures. Source-status
  `decision` and `safe_next_slice` text must also be non-whitespace, and
  recognized command-token fields, source-status cross-links, and resolved
  question source paths must have the expected text/list/object shapes.
  Source-status `resolution_question_evidence` IDs must match unresolved
  `required_resolution_questions` IDs in the same source-status record.
  When a source-status record has unresolved `required_resolution_questions`,
  `resolution_question_evidence` must cover every unresolved question ID.
  Unresolved and resolved source-status question IDs must each be unique inside
  a single source-status record, so set-based coverage checks cannot hide
  duplicate blockers or duplicate settled decisions.
  When a source-status record declares `execution_readiness.decision` as
  `blocked`, its `blocked_by_resolution_questions` list must also cover every
  unresolved question ID. A source-status record also cannot set
  `execution_change_allowed` to `true` while unresolved
  `required_resolution_questions` remain, or while `execution_readiness.decision`
  is `blocked`.
  Source-status cross-link paths and resolved question source paths must also
  point to existing files that contain JSON objects.
  Accepted source-status records must also provide non-empty top-level
  `as_boundary` text so the JSON frontier explains the AS boundary it is
  enforcing.
- `python -m autarkic_systems.source_status --format json` emits a focused
  source-status frontier report as schema-versioned machine-readable JSON:
  accepted/rejected state, failed subjects, blocked command tokens,
  per-source decisions, blocked runtime surfaces, AS boundaries, unresolved
  questions, source evidence for those questions, resolved decisions,
  execution-readiness gates, latest source-review gates, source-status
  cross-links, closure summary, missing/invalid source-status paths, and the
  safe next slice. The closure summary reports schema version `4` state for the
  safe-next queue, remaining blocked commands, preserved unsupported commands,
  implemented commands, execution-change allowance, and the stable reason for
  the closed current queue.
  The shared validator rejects
  frontier records whose question IDs are simultaneously unresolved and
  resolved, and rejects execution-readiness blockers that do not match live
  unresolved questions or only partially cover them. It also rejects readiness
  records that allow execution changes while unresolved questions remain or
  while the readiness decision is `blocked`, and rejects
  `latest_source_review` links that are missing, malformed, or disagree with
  their linked review artifact. Text mode renders the same frontier for
  operator diagnosis.

## Fast Verification

```sh
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite fast
```

The suite selector is defined by `tests/suite_manifest.json`. It keeps the
default feedback path separate from the explicit fixed-point/status extended
suite:

```sh
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite fast --list
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite fast --list --format json
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite extended-fixed-point --list
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite extended-fixed-point --list --format json
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite extended-fixed-point
python -m autarkic_systems.test_suite_selection --suite all
```

`python -m unittest discover` remains the plain unittest discovery command, but
it does not separate the extended fixed-point regressions from the fast path.

The current executable probes live in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py` and
`autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`, with claim-manifest,
proof-certificate, and object-language support in
`autarkic_systems/claim_manifest.py`, `autarkic_systems/proof_certificates.py`,
`autarkic_systems/object_language.py`, and
`autarkic_systems/willard_map.py`. Source-backed structured maps also live in
`autarkic_systems/prc_hardware_map.py` and
`autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py`, with schematic-linked trace support in
`autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` and generated SVG support in
`autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py`. They are covered by `tests/`.

## Subordinate Programs

Autarkic Systems currently subsumes three named programs:

- Autarkic Formal Systems (`jpt4/afs`): the immediate formal-systems layer.
  At the reviewed snapshot it is only a placeholder README, so this repository
  must supply the first serious integration structure.
- Pervasively Reconfigurable Computing (`jpt4/prc`): the embodied computing
  substrate. It studies Universal Cells, geometrically explicit logic circuits,
  reversible logic elements with memory, explicit routing, and physically
  grounded reconfiguration.
- Self-Justifying Axiom Systems (`jpt4/sjas`): the formal-confidence substrate.
  It studies Willard-style self-justifying axiom systems, self-provability of
  consistency under tuned expressivity, and executable fragments in Racket,
  Clojure/core.logic, and Proflog-adjacent work.

## Development Discipline

Follow `AGENTS.md` before changing this repository. In brief:

- ADRs precede feature implementation.
- Tests precede code when code is added.
- Documentation belongs in the right layer: `LOG.md` for chronology,
  `MEMORY.md` for high-priority future context, `LESSONS.md` for durable
  lessons, and README files for current entrypoints.
- Branches should follow the ADR structure of the work.

The default branch is currently `main`, even though `AGENTS.md` refers to
`master` in its generic branch-discipline text. Until the repository owner
changes the remote default branch, use `main` as the integration branch while
preserving the ADR-shaped branch flow.
