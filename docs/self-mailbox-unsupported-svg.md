# Self Mailbox Unsupported SVG

Status: sixth rendered schematic view, 2026-05-17.

This SVG is the rendered view of the structured unsupported self-mailbox trace.
It is not a separate design source. The authoritative artifact remains
`schematics/self_mailbox_unsupported_trace.json`, and the checked-in SVG must
match `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` renderer output exactly.

The rendered artifact lives in `schematics/self_mailbox_unsupported_trace.svg`.

## Render Boundary

The SVG shows:

- the triangular RLEM/Universal Cell node;
- north, east, and west ports from the structured trace;
- stem role and `step_stem_cell` transition function;
- `self_mailbox` before and after `write-buf-one`;
- control and buffer state before and after preservation;
- the recorded unsupported-flow text;
- the four interpretive layer IDs from the shared schematic schema.

The SVG does not claim write-buffer execution, `standard-signal` command
execution, neighbor delivery, dynamic GELC reconfiguration, or physical
circulator verification. It renders the one `write-buf-one` unsupported
self-mailbox trace from ADR-0035.

ADR-0073 regenerates the SVG from the claim-aligned trace so the evidence
bundle can validate the claim example, JSON trace, and rendered artifact as one
exact path.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_self_mailbox_unsupported_svg
```

The test parses the SVG as XML, checks its trace metadata, port and layer data
attributes, confirms the unsupported mailbox preservation details are visible,
and verifies that the committed SVG exactly matches renderer output for the
current JSON trace.

## Regeneration

If the JSON trace changes, regenerate the SVG through `render_schematic_svg()`
and keep the test output green. Do not edit the SVG by hand unless the renderer
is updated in the same ADR.
