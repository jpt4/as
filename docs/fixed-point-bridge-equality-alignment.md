# Fixed-Point Bridge Equality Alignment

Status: finite bridge-equality alignment evidence, not an equality proof,
2026-05-19.

ADR-0267 adds `claims/fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment.json` and
`autarkic_systems/fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment.py`. The surface checks
the fourth fixed-point construction proof case against the current
fixed-point equation bridge, substitution-witness bridge, graph correctness
bridge, and formula-schema witness relation.

## Purpose

ADR-0263 made `bridge-equality-proof` the fourth open construction case.
ADR-0267 narrows that case from broad dependency names to a finite checked
alignment point.

The verifier derives the current bridge-equality alignment and checks that:

- the fixed-point construction case remains open;
- the construction case requires the equation bridge, substitution witness,
  graph correctness cases, and bridge-equality alignment;
- the equation bridge, witness bridge, graph correctness bridge, and
  formula-schema relation remain accepted;
- the bridge equation length matches the formula-schema witness instance
  length;
- the left bridge term matches the witness output quotation boundary;
- the right bridge term quotes the checked diagonal instance; and
- the target and witness route identifiers agree.

## Run

```sh
python -m autarkic_systems.fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment
python -m autarkic_systems.fixed_point_bridge_equality_alignment --format json
python -m autarkic_systems.fixed_point_construction_cases
python -m autarkic_systems.formal_confidence
python -m autarkic_systems.project_status --format summary
```

The validator checks that:

- the construction-case, equation bridge, substitution-witness bridge,
  substitution graph correctness bridge, and formula-schema relation
  dependencies remain accepted;
- exactly one bridge-equality alignment point is derived;
- the bridge equation code length remains 4815;
- the route and length-alignment booleans hold; and
- future work and non-claims remain explicit.

## Boundary

This is not a bridge equality proof, not a fixed-point equation proof, not an
arithmetized proof predicate, and not a self-consistency theorem. The
formal-confidence target remains blocked on `fixed-point-construction`.
