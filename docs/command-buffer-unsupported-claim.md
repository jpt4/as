# Command Buffer Unsupported Claim

Status: named claim and proof-certificate surface, 2026-05-17.

ADR-0041 promotes the unsupported completed command-buffer boundary into the
transition-claim surface. The claim is
`UC-STEM-COMMAND-BUFFER-UNSUPPORTED-APPENDED` in
`claims/transition_claims.json`, checked by
`stem_command_buffer_preserves_unsupported_completion` in
`autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`.
ADR-0042 adds a schematic-linked trace for one positive neighbor-target
example.

## Claim Boundary

The claim covers command-buffer transitions where a standard-signal append
completes a five-bit buffer that is outside the ADR-0037 self-target
init-family execution slice. That includes:

- neighbor-target completed buffers;
- self-target `standard-signal`;
- self-target `write-buf-zero`;
- self-target `write-buf-one`.

The predicate checks that the transition remains at `stem-buffer-appended`,
clears consumed input, preserves output, preserves role/memory/upstream,
preserves the control rail, keeps automail and `self_mailbox` empty, and leaves
the completed five-bit buffer intact.

The claim does not define neighbor routing, self-target `standard-signal`,
write-buffer commands, or full command-buffer execution.

## Proof Surface

`claims/proof_certificates.json` covers the claim with `manifest-example`
steps for positive self non-init and neighbor-target examples plus a negative
wrongly processed neighbor example.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_command_buffer_unsupported_claim
```

The tests cover the predicate, manifest examples, proof certificate coverage,
and object-language predicate vocabulary.
