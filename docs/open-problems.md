# Open Problems

Status: first ranking, 2026-05-17.

These are project problems, not generic research wishes. Each one should be
able to generate one or more ADRs.

## P1: Formalize The Current Transition Predicates

Question: What is the smallest object-language vocabulary that can state the
four predicates already implemented over Universal Cell transition results?

Why it matters: This is the shortest bridge from executable substrate behavior
to formal claims.

Status: started by ADR-0007. `claims/transition_claims.json` names the current
predicate claims and executable examples. Remaining work is to add proof objects
or proof-apparatus clauses behind those claim IDs. ADR-0011 adds the first
minimal proof certificates over the manifest examples; richer object-language
proof clauses remain open.

## P2: Expand From Fixed Roles To Stem/Reconfiguration

Question: Which stem-cell transition subset is small enough to test without
pretending to reimplement all of PRC?

Why it matters: Reconfiguration is central to PRC and AS, while the current
probe only covers fixed wire/proc behavior.

Status: started by ADR-0008. `step_stem_cell` now covers automail
reconfiguration commands `wr`, `wl`, `pr`, and `pl`. Full stem input
classification and buffer processing remain open. ADR-0009 added the
corresponding `automail_reconfigures_stem` predicate and manifest claim.

## P3: Choose The First Proof Apparatus

Question: Should AS start with a tiny local tableaux checker, a repaired public
Proflog, or a reference to another transparent tableaux implementation?

Why it matters: SJAS requirements depend on proof apparatus details; AS cannot
claim formal self-confidence without one.

Status: decided by ADR-0010. AS will start with a minimal local
proof-certificate checker over the current transition-claim surface, use
LeanTAP as a transparent tableaux reference, and keep Proflog/Fitting as the
long-term SJAS-aligned path once the active frontier is recovered or replaced.

Status update: ADR-0011 added the first local proof-certificate checker for the
current transition claims.

## P4: Define The First Object Language

Question: What syntax is sufficient for the first AS claims: transition
predicates only, IS(A)-style arithmetic fragments, or both?

Why it matters: AFS-R2 requires explicit syntax classes for terms, formulae,
sentences, proof objects, and substrate claims.

Status: started by ADR-0012. `language/transition_claim_language.json` now
names the first explicit syntax classes for current transition claims, and
`autarkic_systems/object_language.py` validates the current claim/certificate
surface against that language. IS(A), Type NS, tableaux syntax, and
arithmetized proof-code syntax remain open.

## P5: Annotate Core Willard Sources At Definition Granularity

Question: Which definitions and theorem statements from Willard 2001, 2011,
2016, and 2020 are actually needed for the first AS formal-confidence claim?

Why it matters: Current SJAS evidence is strong at the repository level, but AS
needs exact theorem/definition anchors before it can make non-hand-wavy claims.

Status: started by ADR-0013. `docs/willard-definition-map.md` and
`sources/willard_definition_map.json` now identify the first definition,
construction, theorem, and boundary anchors from Willard 2001, 2011, 2016, and
2020, with local PDF witnesses and AS relevance. Remaining work is to turn one
of those anchors into executable syntax, proof-code, or proof-apparatus
machinery.

## P6: Recover Or Replace The Active Proflog Frontier

Question: Where is the Proflog ADR-006x work described in SJAS logs, and should
AS depend on it?

Why it matters: Public Proflog `main` does not match the active SJAS log and
does not run under Guile in this environment.

Likely next artifact: a source-status note or issue draft documenting the gap,
plus a decision on whether to repair, replace, or ignore public Proflog.

## P7: Hardware/Schematic Evidence Path

Question: What is the smallest schematic or simulation artifact that honors
PRC's physical implementation claims without requiring full hardware design?

Why it matters: The AS prelude explicitly includes schematics and hardware
simulation as lower-bound project content.

Likely next artifact: a PRC hardware witness map around RLEM, GELC, circulator,
RALA, and lattice geometry sources.
