# Command-Buffer Unsupported Evidence Bundle

ADR-0075 adds `evidence/command_buffer_unsupported_bundle.json`, the seventh
AS transition evidence bundle.

The bundle's trace-aligned primary example is
`self write buffer command remains appended`, where a matching standard input
completes buffer `00111`, decodes it as `self/write-buf-one`, and preserves
the completed command buffer at the append boundary.

ADR-0120 also records broader `covered_positive_examples` for the same claim:

- `self standard signal command remains appended`;
- `self write buffer zero command remains appended`; and
- `self write buffer command remains appended`.

## Evidence Path

The bundle points to:

- `claims/transition_claims.json`;
- `claims/proof_certificates.json`;
- `schematics/command_buffer_unsupported_trace.json`;
- `schematics/command_buffer_unsupported_trace.svg`;
- `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json`;
- `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json`;
- `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`;
- `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json`; and
- `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`.

The evidence bundle validator checks that the trace-aligned append-boundary
claim example evaluates true, every covered positive example exists and
evaluates true with the expected status, the proof certificate is accepted,
the schematic trace executes and matches the exact primary claim example, the
committed SVG matches renderer output, and the source-status boundary files
remain present and parseable.

## Boundary

The bundle records self-target non-init command-buffer append preservation
only. It does not add write-buffer command-token execution,
`standard-signal` command-token execution, recipient non-init command
execution, priority, or sequencing.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_command_buffer_unsupported_evidence_bundle
python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json
```

The tests cover the bundle fields, covered examples, path set, cross-layer
validation, registry entry, drifted covered-example rejection, and drifted
status rejection.
