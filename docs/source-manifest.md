# Source Manifest

The machine-readable manifest is `sources/manifest.json`.

It records the source repositories that currently define the AS working
context:

- `as`: the root Autarkic Systems repository;
- `afs`: the named Autarkic Formal Systems subordinate program;
- `prc`: the embodied substrate and reconfigurable hardware program;
- `sjas`: the self-justifying logic program;
- `proflog`: an adjacent semantic-tableaux candidate referenced by current
  SJAS notes but not yet confirmed as the active executable frontier.

## Verification

Fast structural check:

```sh
jq -e . sources/manifest.json
```

Manual source checks:

```sh
git -C /home/sean/Projects/as rev-parse HEAD
git -C /home/sean/Projects/_upstream/afs rev-parse HEAD
git -C /home/sean/Projects/_upstream/prc rev-parse HEAD
git -C /home/sean/Projects/_upstream/sjas rev-parse HEAD
git -C /home/sean/Projects/_upstream/proflog rev-parse HEAD
```

## Notes

- The AS local repository is ahead of public `origin/main` because pushing to
  `jpt4/as` returned HTTP 403 for the current GitHub account. Local commits are
  still preserved in the branch history.
- The AS `reviewed_commit` records the local integration baseline before
  ADR-0003. The commit containing the manifest necessarily advances AS beyond
  that value, so exact HEAD equality is expected only for the upstream reference
  repositories.
- `jpt4/proflog` is included as adjacent, not subordinate. It is relevant
  because SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md` records recent Proflog-side SJAS work, but the
  public Proflog main branch does not contain the newer ADR-006x material.
- Public Proflog did not pass an execution smoke test under Guile in this
  environment. That failure is a gap to track, not a reason to block AS work.
