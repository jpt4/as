# Literature Map

Status: first pass, 2026-05-17.

This map organizes sources by the role they play in Autarkic Systems. It is not
a claim that the literature review is complete. It is a working index for
turning source pressure into ADRs, executable probes, and proof obligations.

## Root And Integration Sources

| Source | Local witness | AS role | Current use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AS prelude and development rules | `AGENTS.md` | Defines the lower-bound objective: theory, literature organization, novel conceptual contributions, executable artifacts, and hardware schematics/simulation for cognitive sovereignty. | Governs all ADRs and documentation layers. |
| AFS placeholder | `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/afs/README.md` | Names Autarkic Formal Systems but does not operationalize it. | Forces AS to define AFS requirements locally. |
| AS source manifest | `sources/manifest.json` | Pins the reviewed repository baseline. | Prevents source drift from silently changing conclusions. |

## PRC: Substrate And Embodiment

| Source | Local witness | AS role | Current use |

| Source | Local witness | AS role | Current use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proflog public repo | `/home/sean/Projects/_upstream/proflog/proflog.scm` | Candidate Fitting-style semantic-tableaux implementation. | Background only; public main failed the local Guile smoke test and does not expose the newer SJAS ADR-006x frontier. |

## Claim-To-Source Map

| AS claim | Source support | Evidence status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AS must join formal self-confidence to embodied substrate visibility. | AS prelude, PRC README, SJAS README. | Strong enough for roadmap and requirements. |
| AFS cannot currently be delegated to `jpt4/afs`. | AFS placeholder README. | Verified at reviewed commit. |
| Universal Cell routing is a valid first executable substrate slice. | PRC formal model, PRC README, GELC note. | Partially implemented in AS fixed-role probe. |
| Fixed-role transition predicates are only a bridge, not a proof of PRC. | PRC formal model has broader stem/automail/buffer behavior. | Explicit coverage limit in ADR-0004 and ADR-0005. |
| SJAS work requires careful expressivity/proof-apparatus tradeoffs. | SJAS README and Willard witness archive. | Strong enough for AFS requirements; detailed theorem claims still need paper-level annotation. |
| Proflog is relevant but not currently a passing dependency. | SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md`, public Proflog repo, failed Guile run. | Gap recorded in `docs/afs-requirements.md` and `sources/manifest.json`. |
| Public Proflog main must not be treated as the active ADR-006x implementation. | `docs/proflog-frontier-status.md`, `sources/proflog_frontier_status.json`, public `jpt4/proflog` main at `77af848`, and SJAS `nachlass/LOG.md`. | ADR-0014 records the source-status decision and maintainer question. |
| AS should start proof work with a tiny local certificate checker. | Current claim manifest, LeanTAP source, public Proflog source, SJAS Proflog boundary log. | Decision recorded in ADR-0010 and `docs/proof-apparatus-options.md`. |
| AS cannot claim Willard-style formal confidence until it preserves exact syntax, proof-code, deduction-method, and consistency-level anchors. | Willard 2001 Definitions 1.1/1.2 and Theorem 4.3; Willard 2011 Definitions 3.4/5.6/5.7 and Theorem 5.9; Willard 2016 Definitions 3.2/3.4/4.1 and Theorem 6.7; Willard 2020 Definitions 3.2/3.4 and Theorems 4.4/4.5. | First anchored in ADR-0013, `docs/willard-definition-map.md`, and `sources/willard_definition_map.json`. |
| AS hardware/schematic artifacts must preserve PRC's actual commitments rather than merely resembling PRC diagrams. | PRC README, GELC universality note, Morita RLEM witness, PRC formal model, ASM simulator, old Thiel/RALA notes, and PRC figures. | First anchored in ADR-0015, `docs/prc-hardware-witness-map.md`, and `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json`. |
| A PRC-derived schematic key can be tied to executable AS behavior before larger circuit design. | ADR-0015 witness map, AS Universal Cell probe, and `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json`. | First implemented in ADR-0016 with validation in `tests/test_single_node_schematic_trace.py`. |
| A rendered schematic can stay subordinate to a structured executable trace. | `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.json`, `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py`, and `schematics/single_node_triangular_rlem_trace.svg`. | First implemented in ADR-0017 with exact renderer-output matching tests. |
| Schematic-linked traces can cover processor memory toggle without adding new UC semantics. | AS Universal Cell processor probe and `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json`. | Implemented in ADR-0018 with validation in `tests/test_processor_memory_toggle_trace.py`. |
| A generic schematic SVG renderer can render fixed-role wire and processor traces while preserving JSON authority. | `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.json`, `schematics/processor_memory_toggle_trace.svg`, and `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0020 with exact renderer-output matching tests for wire and processor SVGs. |
| Schematic-linked traces can cover the first stem automail reconfiguration subset without claiming full dynamic reconfiguration. | AS Universal Cell stem automail probe and `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json`. | Implemented in ADR-0019 with validation in `tests/test_stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.py`. |
| A stem reconfiguration SVG must expose role and automail changes, not only port geometry. | `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.json`, `schematics/stem_automail_reconfiguration_trace.svg`, and `tests/test_stem_automail_svg.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0021 with exact renderer-output matching and drift rejection. |
| Stem command-buffer behavior can advance in a bounded subset before full command execution. | PRC formal model, `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`, and `tests/test_stem_buffer_accumulation.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0022 for high-rail selection and bit accumulation only. |
| Stem buffer accumulation belongs in the named claim surface before command decoding depends on it. | `claims/transition_claims.json`, `claims/proof_certificates.json`, and `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0023 with positive/negative manifest examples and certificate coverage. |
| Schematic-linked stem traces must distinguish automail reconfiguration from standard-signal buffer accumulation. | `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py` and `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.json`. | Implemented in ADR-0024 with separate buffer alignment validation. |
| A stem buffer render must expose command-buffer state, not only role and port geometry. | `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py` and `schematics/stem_buffer_accumulation_trace.svg`. | Implemented in ADR-0025 with exact renderer-output matching and drift rejection. |
| Stem full-buffer execution needs an explicit target/command map before code mutates cells or routes messages. | PRC formal model, `sources/stem_command_buffer_map.json`, and `autarkic_systems/stem_command_map.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0026 as a validated decoder only. |
| Stem command execution needs source-status separation before AS trusts legacy simulator sketches. | PRC formal model, legacy `raa.scm`, legacy `semsim.scm`, legacy `fsmsim.scm`, and `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json`. | Implemented in ADR-0027 as a do-not-execute-yet decision with allowed narrower next slices. |
| Self-target stem command work needs a first-class mailbox field before execution. | PRC formal model process-buffer sketch, `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`, and `language/transition_claim_language.json`. | Implemented in ADR-0028 as representation only, with reset clearing and parser/trace preservation. |
| Neighbor-target stem command work needs command-message channel tokens before delivery. | PRC formal model process-buffer sketch, `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`, and `language/transition_claim_language.json`. | Implemented in ADR-0029 as representation only, with blocked-output preservation and no command execution. |

| Unsupported self-mailbox commands should be preserved as an explicit boundary claim until their semantics are resolved. | `claims/transition_claims.json`, `claims/proof_certificates.json`, and `autarkic_systems/transition_predicates.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0034 with positive/negative manifest examples and certificate coverage. |
| Schematic-linked evidence should cover the self-mailbox init subset before larger command-routing traces. | `schematics/self_mailbox_init_trace.json`, `autarkic_systems/schematic_trace.py`, and `tests/test_self_mailbox_init_trace.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0032 with replay and drift rejection. |
| A self-mailbox init render must expose mailbox consumption rather than only role reconfiguration. | `autarkic_systems/schematic_svg.py`, `schematics/self_mailbox_init_trace.svg`, and `tests/test_self_mailbox_init_svg.py`. | Implemented in ADR-0033 with exact renderer-output matching and drift rejection. |

## Evidence Gaps

- The X/Twitter reference in `AGENTS.md` remains uncaptured.
- Willard 1993 and Willard 1997 public full-text witnesses were not available
  in the SJAS paper archive.
- PRC's Scheme simulator and TLA+ sketch need deeper verification before AS
  treats either as canonical.
- AS has rendered the wire, processor, stem automail, and stem buffer
  PRC-derived traces, and has a stem command-buffer map. Full stem command
  execution, larger GELC, and physical-simulation renders remain open. ADR-0027
  records the current source-status blockers for execution; ADR-0028 clears the
  self-mailbox representation blocker and ADR-0029 clears the command-token
  representation blocker only. ADR-0030 adds self-mailbox init-command
  execution but not full command-buffer execution. ADR-0031 adds a claim and
  proof-certificate surface for that bounded execution subset. ADR-0032 adds a
  schematic-linked trace for one `proc-l-init` self-mailbox command. ADR-0033
  adds a generated SVG render for that trace. ADR-0034 adds an explicit
  claim/proof boundary for the remaining unsupported self-mailbox commands.
- The active Proflog ADR-006x frontier described by SJAS logs is not present on
  public Proflog `main`; ADR-0014 records this as a do-not-depend decision.
- AS has not yet annotated the actual Willard papers at theorem/definition
  granularity beyond the first four-source ADR-0013 map.
- LeanTAP has now been reviewed as a transparency reference, but AS has not
  ported or executed it as a project dependency.
