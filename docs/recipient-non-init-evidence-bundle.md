# Recipient Non-Init Rejection Evidence Bundle

ADR-0068 adds `evidence/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_bundle.json`, the
second AS transition evidence bundle.

The bundle's trace-aligned primary example is the positive
`UC-RECIPIENT-NON-INIT-COMMAND-MESSAGE-REJECTED` example named
`fixed upstream standard-signal command rejected`, where a processor-left
recipient pulls an upstream `standard-signal` command-message token, rejects
it, preserves role and memory, and clears the active command source.

ADR-0163 temporarily extended the bundle's covered positive examples to
include upstream `write-buf-zero` and `write-buf-one` recipient rejections.
ADR-0169 removes those write-buffer examples from this rejection bundle because
single recipient write-buffer command messages now append instead of reject.

## Evidence Path

The bundle points to:

- `claims/transition_claims.json`;
- `claims/proof_certificates.json`;
- `schematics/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.json`;
- `schematics/recipient_non_init_command_rejection_trace.svg`;
- `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json`;
- `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`;
- `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json`;
- `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`; and
- `sources/multi_command_recipient_input_policy_status.json`.

The evidence bundle validator checks that the rejection claim example
evaluates true, every covered positive example evaluates true, the proof
certificate is accepted, the schematic trace executes and validates against
the PRC hardware witness map, the committed SVG matches renderer output, and
the source-status boundary files remain present and parseable.

## Boundary

The bundle records a rejection boundary, not new recipient command execution.
`standard-signal` and multi-command recipient inputs remain governed by
source-status blockers and rejection policy. Direct self-mailbox, completed
self-target command-buffer, and single delivered recipient write-buffer
command tokens are separate implemented surfaces.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_recipient_non_init_evidence_bundle
python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json
```

The tests cover the bundle fields, path set, cross-layer validation, registry
entry, and drifted status rejection.
