# Source-Status Frontier

ADR-0145 adds `autarkic_systems/source_status.py`, a focused report over the
command-token source-status records that currently bound AS runtime semantics.

## Purpose

The full project status report validates evidence registries, claim/proof
surfaces, object languages, and the source-status frontier. When the immediate
question is only "what command-token semantics are still blocked, and why?",
that broad report can obscure the answer.

The source-status frontier report narrows the first-run surface to the current
command-token blockers:

- `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`;
- `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json`; and
- `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`.

## Run

```sh
python -m autarkic_systems.source_status
python -m autarkic_systems.source_status --format json
```

Use repeated `--source-status <path>` arguments to validate a specific frontier
subset or a scratch fixture.

The report names:

- accepted or rejected state;
- failed subjects for missing, malformed, or schema-invalid source-status
  records;
- blocked command tokens;
- accepted source-status file paths and decisions;
- blocked runtime surfaces;
- AS boundaries;
- unresolved resolution questions and summaries;
- source evidence explaining why unresolved questions remain open;
- resolved resolution questions and details;
- source-status cross-links behind the blocker trail;
- the safe next slice; and
- missing or invalid source-status paths.

JSON mode emits the same surface with top-level `schema_version: 1`.

ADR-0146 tightens the shared validation contract: source evidence question IDs
must match unresolved question IDs in the same source-status record. A typo or
stale evidence ID rejects the source-status record as `source-status-schema`.
ADR-0147 requires source evidence coverage for every unresolved question ID in
the same source-status record. Missing or partial evidence coverage rejects the
source-status record as `source-status-schema`.
ADR-0148 moves the standard-signal `recipient-surface` question from
unresolved to resolved, tying delivered recipient `standard-signal` command
messages to the existing non-init rejection boundary.
ADR-0149 rejects any source-status record that lists the same question ID as
both unresolved and resolved, so the focused frontier cannot present a blocker
as live and settled at the same time.
ADR-0150 moves the standard-signal `command-token-vs-binary-input` question
from unresolved to resolved, recording that command tokens do not replay
ordinary binary-input standard-signal behavior by default.
ADR-0151 moves the standard-signal `self-target-surface` question from
unresolved to resolved, so the standard-signal source-status record no longer
has live resolution questions.

## Boundary

This is not a separate source-status authority. It reuses the same frontier
validation used by `python -m autarkic_systems.project_status` so the focused
command and the aggregate command cannot accept different command-token
schemas.
