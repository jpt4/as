# Stem Buffer Accumulation

Status: first standard-signal stem buffer subset, 2026-05-17.

This note records the first `step_stem_cell` behavior beyond explicit automail
reconfiguration. PRC's formal model describes stem cells using standard signals
to select a high rail and accumulate a five-bit command buffer before later
command processing. ADR-0022 implements only that accumulation boundary.

The implementation lives in `autarkic_systems/universal_cell.py`. ADR-0023
promotes the implemented subset into the named claim
`UC-STEM-BUFFER-ACCUMULATES`.

## Implemented Behavior

When a stem cell has no automail command and its output is empty:

- a one-hot standard input selects the control rail if no control rail is set;
- a matching one-hot input appends `1` to a non-full buffer;
- a non-matching one-hot input appends `0` to a non-full buffer;
- a full five-bit buffer returns `stem-buffer-full` without consuming input;
- malformed stem input is rejected and cleared.

Automail reconfiguration still has priority over standard-signal buffering.

## Source Boundary

This slice follows the PRC formal-model text that describes the constant-count
five-bit command buffer and the `stem-process-standard-signal` transitions. It
does not implement the later `process-buffer` step, command decoding, target
selection, neighbor delivery, or dynamic GELC reconfiguration.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_stem_buffer_accumulation tests.test_stem_automail
```

The tests cover high-rail selection, matching and non-matching bit append,
full-buffer boundary behavior, malformed-input rejection, and automail priority.
