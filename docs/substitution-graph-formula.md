# Substitution Graph Formula Schema

Status: checked formula schema, not a correctness proof, 2026-05-18.

ADR-0248 adds `claims/substitution_graph_formula_candidates.json` and
`autarkic_systems/substitution_graph_formula.py`. It records the first checked
syntactic formula candidate for the ADR-0246 substitution graph target:
`substitution_code(x,y) = z`. ADR-0249 makes this candidate a structured
dependency of the aggregate formal-confidence target, so formal-confidence
validation fails closed if this surface drifts. ADR-0250 adds a concrete
witness evaluator for the checked formula instance. ADR-0251 adds finite
evaluation examples around the same substitution graph path.

## Purpose

The substitution graph target names the relation AS needs for the diagonal
route, but the target alone is not a formula. This surface constructs the
first candidate formula schema and checks that it is stable under the current
formal codebook and witness data.

The schema records:

- relation target `subst_code_graph`;
- formula class `delta0`;
- graph variables `x`, `y`, and `z`;
- formula node `substitution_code(x,y) = z`;
- code for that formula node; and
- one closed witness instance formed by substituting the checked witness codes
  into the formula; and
- one concrete evaluation of that witness relation.

## Current Candidate

`AS-SUBSTITUTION-GRAPH-DELTA0-SCHEMA` is
`formula-schema-not-proved`.

The formula node is:

```text
substitution_code(x,y) = z
```

The checked formula code is:

```text
[21, 18, 11, 1, 11, 2, 11, 3]
```

The checked formula free variables are:

```text
x, y, z
```

The witness instance substitutes quoted formula, argument, and output codes
from `AS-SUBSTITUTION-REPRESENTABILITY-DIAGONAL-SEED-WITNESS`. The resulting
instance is closed, has code length `4815`, and begins:

```text
[21, 18, 17, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13]
```

The concrete witness evaluator decodes the quoted formula and argument codes,
substitutes the quoted argument into the decoded formula at the witness
variable, and compares the encoded output to the quoted right-hand side. For
this witness, the relation evaluates true. The evaluated output has code
length `296` and begins:

```text
[41, 1, 22, 11, 1, 18, 17, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13]
```

## Run

```sh
python -m autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_formula
python -m autarkic_systems.substitution_graph_formula --format json
```

The validator checks that:

- the formal arithmetic language, formal codebook, substitution graph target,
  and substitution-representability witness dependencies remain accepted;
- candidate IDs are unique;
- the candidate preserves `formula-schema-not-proved`;
- the relation name is `subst_code_graph`;
- the formula class is `delta0`;
- the formula node is exactly `substitution_code(x,y) = z`;
- the formula code and free variables match the manifest; and
- the checked witness instance length, prefix, and free-variable boundary
  match the manifest; and
- the concrete witness relation evaluates true with the expected output code
  facts.

## Boundary

This is not a formula correctness proof, not a substitution representability
proof, not a diagonal lemma, not a fixed-point equation proof, and not a
self-consistency theorem. It evaluates one checked graph point only. The next
AS step is to prove that this formula schema correctly represents the checked
`substitution_code` graph before using it in the diagonal lemma route.
