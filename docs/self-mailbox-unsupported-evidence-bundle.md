# Self-Mailbox Unsupported Evidence Bundle

ADR-0073 adds `evidence/self_mailbox_unsupported_bundle.json`, the fifth AS
transition evidence bundle.

The bundle's trace-aligned primary example is
`write buffer one unsupported preserved`, where a stem-right cell with
`self_mailbox` set to `write-buf-one` reports `self-mailbox-unsupported` and
preserves the cell unchanged.

ADR-0120 also records broader `covered_positive_examples` for the same claim:

- `standard signal unsupported preserved`;
- `write buffer zero unsupported preserved`; and
- `write buffer one unsupported preserved`.

## Evidence Path

The bundle points to:

- `claims/transition_claims.json`;
- `claims/proof_certificates.json`;
- `schematics/self_mailbox_unsupported_trace.json`;
- `schematics/self_mailbox_unsupported_trace.svg`;
- `sources/prc_hardware_witness_map.json`;
- `sources/stem_command_execution_source_status.json`;
- `sources/recipient_non_init_command_source_status.json`;
- `sources/standard_signal_command_semantics_status.json`; and
- `sources/write_buffer_command_semantics_status.json`.

The evidence bundle validator checks that the trace-aligned preservation claim
example evaluates true, every covered positive example exists and evaluates
true with the expected status, the proof certificate is accepted, the
schematic trace executes and matches the exact primary claim example, the
committed SVG matches renderer output, and the source-status boundary files
remain present and parseable.

## Boundary

The bundle records unsupported self-mailbox preservation only. It does not add
write-buffer command-token execution, `standard-signal` command-token
execution, recipient non-init command execution, priority, or sequencing.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_self_mailbox_unsupported_evidence_bundle
python -m autarkic_systems.evidence_bundle --registry evidence/manifest.json
```

The tests cover the bundle fields, covered examples, path set, cross-layer
validation, registry entry, drifted covered-example rejection, and drifted
status rejection.
